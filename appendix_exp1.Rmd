# Experiment 1 {#exp1}

## Participants

We recruited 200 participants from the US via prolific. 6 participants failed our attention check, resulting in a final sample of `r exp1_descriptives$n_subj` participants (`r exp1_descriptives$gender$female$n` female, `r exp1_descriptives$gender$male$n` male; $age_\text{mean}$: `r exp1_descriptives$age$mean`, $age_\text{sd}$: `r exp1_descriptives$age$sd`, $age_\text{median}$: `r exp1_descriptives$age$median`). Since we did not have any prior assumptions on effect sizes, we did not do a power analysis.

### Conspiracy scales

Beside Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by @pennycookOverconfidentlyConspiratorialConspiracy2022 which report in the main study, we also assessed two other consipiracy thinking measures: 

1. The conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) by @bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013:
I think that . . .

-   ... many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about. - politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.
-   ... government agencies closely monitor all citizens.
-   ... events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.
-   ... there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions.

[0% - 100%; 0 = certainly not, 100 = certain]

2.  The Single Item Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (SICBS) by @lantianMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2016 :

-   I think that the official version of the events given by the authorities very often hides the truth. [1-9; 1 = Completely false, 5 = Unsure, 9 = Completely true]

### Trust in science

We rely on three items

1. How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

2. In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

3. How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the public? [1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence]

## Results

Regarding RQ1 and RQ2, participants answered on average `r exp1_descriptives$means$knowledge_mean` (sd = `r exp1_descriptives$means$knowledge_sd`) of the questions correctly, and accepted the scientific consensus on average for `r exp1_descriptives$means$acceptance_mean` (sd = `r exp1_descriptives$means$acceptance_sd`) of the questions.

Fig. \@ref(fig:exp1-conditional-acceptance) illustrates the relationship between knowledge and acceptance. In most cases (`r exp1_descriptives$conditional_acceptance$false$Yes$share`), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus after having given the wrong answer to a question. In very few cases (`r exp1_descriptives$conditional_acceptance$true$No$share`), participants who gave the correct response afterwards rejected the scientific consensus, thereby contradicting their own initial response. We believe this might have been due to inattention.

For RQ3, we find a positive but small correlation between both science knowledge and trust in science (r = `r exp1_descriptives$cor_trust_knowledge$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$cor_trust_knowledge$p.value`), and acceptance of scientific consensus and trust in science (r = `r exp1_descriptives$cor_trust_acceptance$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$cor_trust_acceptance$p.value`). The more people are knowledgeable about science and the more they tend to accept the scientific consensus, the more they tend to trust science. These correlations are relatively weak, which might be partly due to ceiling effects: As illustrated in Fig. \@ref(fig:exp1-plot), (i) most people do trust science, and (ii) that is true even among people with low knowledge or acceptance rates.

For RQ4, we find a negative correlation of similar magnitude between conspiracy thinking and science knowledge (r = `r exp1_descriptives$cor_conspiracy_knowledge$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$cor_conspiracy_knowledge$p.value`), and conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus (r = `r exp1_descriptives$cor_conspiracy_acceptance$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$cor_conspiracy_acceptance$p.value`).

In Appendix \@ref(exp1), we show that these associations are robust when using alternative measures of trust and conspiracy thinking. Appendix \@ref(exp1) also includes more descriptive statistics, such as knowledge and acceptance by science questions.

Are trust in science and conspiracy thinking, respectively, associated with being more easily convinced of the scientific consensus? In our main analyses, we looked at correlations of acceptance across all observations. One possibility is that the associations between trust in science/conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus are explained by science knowledge: People who give the right answer in the first place are more ready to accept the consensus, and trust in science/conspiracy thinking are mostly associated with this knowledge, but not with willingness to accept the consensus. To addressed this potential confound, in a non-preregistered analysis, we restricted our sample to cases where participants gave the wrong answer to the knowledge question. We then calculated the correlation between trust in science and average acceptance rate by participant. We find no statistically significant correlation of acceptance with neither conspiracy thinking (r = `r exp1_descriptives$false_answers_cor_conspiracy_acceptance$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$false_answers_cor_conspiracy_acceptance$p.value`), nor with trust in science (r = `r exp1_descriptives$false_answers_cor_trust_acceptance$estimate`, p `r exp1_descriptives$false_answers_cor_trust_acceptance$p.value`).

## Discussion

These results suggest that most people accept the scientific consensus most of the time. Even when people do not know the correct answer to a science question, they tend to mostly accept the scientific consensus afterwards. Yet, in `r exp1_descriptives$conditional_acceptance$false$No$share` of the cases, participants rejected the scientific consensus after having given the wrong answer, suggesting that simply stating the consensus is not sufficient to convince participants sometimes. In general, people with lower trust in science and who believe more in conspiracy theories tend to both know less about science and accept the scientific consensus less.
