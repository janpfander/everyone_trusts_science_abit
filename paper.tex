\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Trust in science is related to many desirable outcomes, from acceptance of anthropogenic climate change (ref) or vaccination (ref) to following recommendations during COVID (Algan, Cohen, Davoine, Foucault, \& Stantcheva, 2021), which suggests that trust in science was the most important predictor of these behaviors).

Unfortunately, people who report a high degree of trust in science are a minority in most countries, and they are outnumbered by people who have low trust in science in many areas, e.g., most of Africa and significant parts of Asia (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018, 2020). Moreover, trust in science has recently been declining in some countries (Algan et al., 2021; although see Wellcome Global Monitor, 2021), including the US (Brian \& Tyson, 2023), where it is also increasingly polarizing (Gauchat, 2012; Krause, Brossard, Scheufele, Xenos, \& Franke, 2019; Li \& Qian, 2022). Rejection of science can take the more extreme form of conspiracy theories, many of which question the scientific consensus on vaccination, climate change, and even the shape of the Earth.

What does this apparent rejection of science actually entail? Do people who say they do not trust science much, or who believe in conspiracy theories at odds with well-established science, reject most of science? Or, on the contrary, do they object to a few specific facets of science, while still accepting the overwhelming majority of basic science? Answering this question has theoretical implications: if some people reject science wholesale, then it's possible that their distrust of science causes their rejection of specific scientific theories, or facilitates their acceptance of conspiracy theories; by contrast, if everyone trusts most of science, then the mistrust of specific facets of science is more likely to be post-hoc, a rationalization of other beliefs or behaviors. The present question also has practical implications: many communication attempts leverage the scientific consensus (e.g.~on vaccination, climate change, etc., for review, see Van Stekelenburg, Schaap, Veling, Van 'T Riet, \& Buijzen, 2022; see also VeÄ‡kalov et al., 2024). These attempts are more likely to be successful if everyone trusts basic science than if some people reject science wholesale.

This relative lack of trust in science could mean different things. It could mean that some people reject science wholesale, or at least to a significant extent. Or it could mean that they maintain a high degree of trust in most of science, and only question specific results that happen to contradict specific other beliefs they have (e.g.~creationism), or beliefs that are associated with disliked behaviors (e.g.~vaccination, acting for climate change).

We answer this question by looking at how much Americans accept basic scientific knowledge. We pay special attention to two groups of participants: people who say they don't trust science (much, or at all), and people who endorse science-related conspiracy theories (CTs), or have a CT mindset, since this has been linked with a low degree of trust in science, and that many CTs imply a mistrust of at least some science (vaccination, hydroxychloroquine, etc.).

We briefly review work on trust in science, and science knowledge, before turning to work on CT and trust in science.

\subsection{Trust in science}\label{trust-in-science}

Across the globe, most people say they trust science at least to some extent. In 2018, the Wellcome Global Monitor (WGM) surveyed of over 140'000 people in over 140 countries on trust in science (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018). In 2020, during the first year of the Covid pandemic, a follow up survey was made in 113 countries, involving 119'000 participants (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2020). Across all countries, in 2018, 32\% of participants said they trust science ``a lot'' (41\% in 2020), 45\% trust ``some'' science (39\% in 2020), and only 13\% percent trust science ``not much/ not at all'' (13\% in 2020), while 10\% indicated ``don't know'' (7\% in 2020)\footnote{\url{https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor-covid-19/2020\#gid=6acd&pid=0}\textgreater{}}.

Trust in science also appears to be relatively stable in the US (Funk \& Kennedy, 2020). However, there are some potentially worrying trends: Recently, trust in US has dropped (Brian \& Tyson, 2023), and some evidence suggests increasing polarization of trust in science along political lines (Gauchat, 2012). For example, the partisan divide on the question of whether climate change is a major threat to society has been growing in the last decade\footnote{\url{https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/}} (Kennedy, 2023). A recent study suggests that by some measure, only about half of the US population believes in anthropogenic climate change, and that individuals do mostly not seem to change their mind on on the issue (Motta, 2021).

Trust in science is typically measured in three ways: either asking explicitly about general trust in science or scientists, by asking about science attitudes (e.g.~support for public funding of science), or asking questions about specific, typically contentious, science topics (e.g.~vaccines, climate change, GMOs). It is unclear to which extent these measures capture trust in basic science. To assess this, we can look at the literature on science knowledge.

{[}introduce SK as: that gives us a lower bound of how much people trust basic science{]}

\subsection{Science knowledge}\label{science-knowledge}

Much of the research on public understanding of science measures to which extent people have basic science knowledge (e.g.~``Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?''). For us, these surveys provide a lower bound to how much people trust basic science: people who give the right answer (and not by chance) supposedly trust science on that question. Unfortunately, that lower bound has often been indeed pretty low: researchers have pointed out the deficit in basic science knowledge (Miller, 1998, 2004). For example, only 55\% in the US (in 2014) and only 46\% in the EU (in 2005) knew that antibiotics kill only bacteria and not viruses (Science Literacy et al., 2016). A question that remains is whether people do not provide the right answers because they are not familiar with the scientific consensus, or because they explicitly reject that consensus.

{[}To do: Make a descriptive overview of science knowledge across time/countries.{]}

\subsection{CT and TiS}\label{ct-and-tis}

Recently, the relationship of one group to trust in science (TiS) has been particularly scrutinized: conspiracy theorists (CTists), either defined as people who endorse specific conspiracy theories, or as people who have a conspiracy mindset (Rutjens \& VeÄ‡kalov, 2022; Vranic, Hromatko, \& TonkoviÄ‡, 2022). CTists reject specific science knowledge (related to their CT), and they tend to trust science less on the whole. What remains unclear is to which extent CTists (dis)trust basic science.

\subsection{The present studies}\label{the-present-studies}

In a series of four pre-registered online studies (total n = 782), we asked US participants questions about well-established scientific facts. For each question, we asked participants what they thought the correct answer was (testing their knowledge of science), we informed them of the scientifically accepted correct answer, and asked them whether they accepted it (measuring their trust in basic science). We also measured participants' trust in science using standard measures, as well as their beliefs in various conspiracy theories and their tendency to engage in conspiratorial thinking. The four studies, including materials, hypotheses, and analyses, were pre-registered and all materials and data are accessible via the Open Science Framework (OSF)). The differences between the four studies are summarized presently, and the methods are detailed below.

\subsubsection{Materials}\label{materials}

In Study 1, we used questions drawn from questionnaires of scientific knowledge (e.g.~``Are electrons smaller, larger, or the same size as atoms? {[}Smaller; Same size; Larger{]}''), supplemented by a `trick' question (``Where do trees mainly draw the materials with which they create their mass? {[}Earth; Water; Air{]}''; correct answer: Air). In Studies 2 and 3, this last question was removed. The scientific facts used in Studies 1 to 3 represent long-established and basic knowledge. In Study 4 we used more recent much less basic scientific discoveries (e.g.~``How many more glial cells are there in the brain in comparison with neurons, as established in 2016? {[}The same amount; Twice as many; Tenth as many{]}''; correct answer: The same amount).

\subsubsection{Presentation of the scientific consensus}\label{presentation-of-the-scientific-consensus}

In Study 1, we simply told participants that they would be provided with the scientifically consensual answer. However, for participants to accept this answer, they must not only trust science, but also trust us (that we are presenting them with the actual scientifically consensual answer). To remove this issue, in Studies 2 to 3, we presented participants with a short explanation of the correct answer, as well as links to three sources per answer (e.g.~Wikipedia, National Geographic or NASA). In Study 4, as the topics were more complex, we did not provide an explanation, but we provided two sources per answer.

\subsubsection{Measure of acceptance of the scientific consensus}\label{measure-of-acceptance-of-the-scientific-consensus}

In Study 1, we simply look at whether participants say that they accept the scientifically consensual answer. In the subsequent studies, we asked participants to explain why they disagreed with the scientific consensus. This revealed that a number of participants had made a mistake (misunderstanding, selecting the wrong answer). As a result, in Studies 3 and 4, participants who have indicated that they rejected the scientifically consensual answer were offered the option to revise their answer, or to keep rejecting it.

\subsubsection{Additional questions}\label{additional-questions}

In Studies 3 and 4, we attempted to understand how some people who say they do not trust science still accept scientifically consensual answers, by asking them whether they accepted the answers on the basis of trust in science or because they had independently verified them.

\subsubsection{Samples}\label{samples}

Studies 1 and 2 were conducted on the standard sample of US participants recruited on the platform Prolific Academic. In order to increase the share of participants with low trust in science, and who endorse conspiracy theories, Studies 3 and 4 used the same platform, but only recruited participants who had declared previously being skeptical of vaccination.

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

The main goal of the present studies is descriptive: to find out whether participants who report not trusting science, or who believe in conspiracy theories, still accept most well-established scientific facts. However, we also tested two directional hypotheses (pre-registered as research questions in the Study 1):

\textbf{H1: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge and more acceptance of the scientific consensus}

\textbf{H2: Higher conspiracy thinking/belief is associated with less science knowledge and less acceptance of the scientific consensus}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Deviations from preregistration}\label{deviations-from-preregistration}

For study 2, we restricted our main hypotheses about acceptance to cases in which participants initially provided a wrong answer. The rationale was to see if trust in science or conspiracy belief were associated with a change of mind towards the consensus. We provide results on these conditional correlations--for Study 2 and for all other studies--in the ESM\footnote{Only in study 4 do we find evidence that changing one's mind towards the scientific consensus is associated with (more) trust in science (study 1: r = 0.06, p = 0.387; study 2: r = 0.16, p = 0.051; study 3: r = 0.04, p = 0.619; study 4: r = 0.15, p = 0.037) and only in study 2 evidence that it is associated with (less) conspiracy beliefs and (less) conspiracy thinking (study 1: r = -0.14, p = 0.061; study 2: r = -0.22, p = 0.006; study 3: r = -0.04, p = 0.631; study 4: r = -0.05, p = 0.455).}. However, for the analysis presented here, we proceeded as preregistered for all other studies, by reporting simple, unconditional correlations between acceptance and trust in science, or, respectively, conspiracy belief.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

After providing their consent to participate in the study, participants were given an attention check ``While watching the television, have you ever had a fatal heart attack?'' {[}1-6; 1 = Never, 6 = Often{]}. All participants who did not answer ``1 = Never'' were excluded. Participants then read the following instructions:``We will ask you 10 questions about science. After each question, we will provide you with the scientifically consensual answer and ask whether you accept it.'' Next, participants answered a set of 10 basic science questions (in Study 1 they were randomly selected from a pool of 11 questions, as one `trick' question had been added) in random order. After each question, participants were presented with an answer reflecting the scientific consensus, and asked whether they accepted it. In Studies 2 and 3, participants additionally saw a short explanation, partly based on explanations generated by ChatGPT, and three links to authoritative sources supporting the answer. In Study 4, we provided only two links and no explanation. Participants then answered questions on conspiracy thinking, conspiracy beliefs, and trust in science.

In Studies 2, 3, and 4, we presented participants with open-ended questions so they could explain their rejection of the scientific consensus. In Studies 3 and 4, we additionally gave participants the option to change their answer and accept the scientific consensus. Finally, at the end of Studies 3 and 4, we asked participants: ``For the questions in which you agreed with the scientific consensus, would you say that\ldots?'' The answer options were: (i) ``You mostly agree with the consensus because, on that question, you trust scientists'', (ii) ``You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently verify it'', and (iii) ``Other'', with a text box for participants to explain. Participants who selected ``You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently verify it'', were asked the open-ended follow-up question: ``Could you please tell us how you independently verified the information?''.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

After removing failed attention checks, we were left with a total sample size of 782 (194 in Study 1, 6 failed attention checks; 190 in Study 2, 11 failed attention checks; 200 in Study 3, no failed attention checks; 198 in Study 4, 2 failed attention checks) participants in the US via prolific. Details and demographics can be found in the online supplemental material. While samples for Studies 1 and 2 were convenience samples, Studies 3 and 4 were conducted on a sample holding vaccine-skeptic beliefs. Prolific Academic allows to select participants based on their answers to a range of questions. We picked three of these questions and only recruited participants who met our criteria for each of them:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ``Please describe your attitudes towards the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) vaccines: {[}For (I feel positively about the vaccines); Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines); Neutral (I don't have strong opinions either way); Prefer not to say''{]}. We selected particpants who answered''Against''.
\item
  ``Have you received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination? {[}Yes (at least one dose); No; Prefer not to answer{]}''. We select only people who answered ``No''.
\item
  ``On a scale from 1-7, please rate to what extent you agree with the following statement: I believe that scheduled immunizations are safe for children. {[}1 (totally disagree); 2 (disagree); 3 (somewhat disagree); 4 (neither agree nor disagree); 5 (somewhat agree); 6 (agree); 7 (totally agree); rather not say{]}''. We select only people who answered `1', `2', or `3'.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials-1}

\subsubsection{Scientific facts}\label{scientific-facts}

Studies 1 to 3 used 10 facts drawn from widely used questionnaires about science knowledge (Allum, Sturgis, Tabourazi, \& Brunton-Smith, 2008; Durant, Evans, \& Thomas, 1989; Miller, 1998) sometimes referred to as the ``Oxford scale'' (Gauchat, 2011). A `trick' question was added in Study 1 and removed as its wording proved unclear. Study 4 used 10 more recent scientific discoveries. Table \ref{tab:knowledge} shows all questions and their answer options used in the four studies.

\subsubsection{Conspiracy beliefs}\label{conspiracy-beliefs}

We selected 10 science/health related conspiracy theories from the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) (Pennycook, Binnendyk, \& Rand, 2022) (Table \ref{tab:conspiracy}). Participants were asked: ``Below is a list of events for which the official version has been disputed. For each event, we would like you to indicate to what extent you believe the cover-up version of events is true or false. {[}1-9; labels: 1 - completly false, 5 - unsure, 9 - completely true{]}''.

\subsubsection{Conspiracy thinking}\label{conspiracy-thinking}

We used the four-item conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) (Bruder, Haffke, Neave, Nouripanah, \& Imhoff, 2013) and the single item conspiracy beliefs scale (SICBS) (Lantian, Muller, Nurra, \& Douglas, 2016). Details and comparisons between the scales can be found in the OSM.

\subsubsection{Trust in science}\label{trust-in-science-1}

In all analyses reported in the main paper, we measure trust in science via a question selected from the Wellcome Global Monitor surveys (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018, 2020): ``In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? {[}1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot{]}''. We chose this question as it seemed to be the most general one. In the appendix, we additionally report results for two alternative measures of trust included in our studies: Another from the WGM surveys (``How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? {[}1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot{]}''), and one from the Pew Research Center (``How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the public? {[}1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence{]}''; see e.g. Funk, Johnson, and Hefferon (2019) and used by e.g. Cologna et al. (2024)). We selected these items so that we could compare the answers in our sample to global survey results. We find that all three items are generally highly correlated throughout all studies, and that our results reported here generally replicate when using either of the alternatives measures (with two exceptions: In Study 3, we find no correlation between acceptance and the Pew question; In Study 4, we find a correlation between knowledge and both alternative trust measures, but not with our main measure; see ESM).

\section{Results}\label{results}



\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:summary-plot}Points represent the average share of acceptance and numbers the absolute count of participants as a function of: \textbf{A} the level of trust in science (``In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? {[}1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot{]}''); \textbf{B} the average conspiracy thinking (CMQ, five items on a scale from 0 to 100); \textbf{C} the belief in specific conspiracy theories (i.e.~participants who answered 9, ``completely true'', for a given theory, see Table \ref{tab:conspiracy} for the list of the theories).}
\end{figure}

The main outcome of interest is acceptance of the scientifically consensual facts presented. Overall, acceptance was very high (aggregating across all studies: 95.1 \%; Study 1: 93 \%; Study 2: 98 \%; Study 3: 98 \%; Study 4: 91 \%). Note that this includes both participants who had previously correctly answered the knowledge question, and participants who changed their mind when presented with the scientific consensus. In Studies 3 \& 4, we gave participants a second chance in case they had initially rejected the consensus, which slightly increased acceptance rates in those studies (initial acceptance in Study 3: 96 \%; in Study 4: 86 \%).

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:summary-plot}, these very high rates of acceptance hold for: participants who they do not trust science at all (5.7 \% of participants, acceptance rate of 87.3 \%), participants who rank in the top two deciles of the conspiracy thinking scale (28.8 \% of participants, average acceptance rate of 93.2 \%), participants who consider as ``completely true'' (the maximum of the 9-point scale) conspiracy theories stating that the earth is flat (5.8 \% of participants, acceptance rate of 87.2 \%), or that climate change due to fossil emissions is a hoax (12 \% of participants, acceptance rate of 91.7 \%). This doesn't merely reflect science knowledge: aggregated across all studies--participants only correctly answered 65.8 \% of the questions (Study 1: 74 \%; Study 2: 79 \%; Study 3: 75 \%; Study 4: 36 \%) before they were provided with the scientifically consensual answer. Did participants who had initially gotten it wrong change their minds towards the scientific consensus? Yes. In most cases (study 1: 76.3 \%; study 2: 92.9 \%; study 3: 95.5 \%; study 4: 89.5 \%), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus after having initially given the wrong answer to a question. In very few cases, participants changed their mind away from the scientific consensus. These participants initially gave the correct response, but rejected the scientific consensus right after, thereby contradicting their own initial response (study 1: 1.6 \%; study 2: 0.5 \%; study 3: 0.7 \%; study 4: 5.7 \%).

Regarding H1, we find a consistent association between trust in science and acceptance of the scientific consensus (Studies 1: r = 0.27, p \textless{} .001; 2: r = 0.30, p \textless{} .001; 3: r = 0.20, p = 0.019; 4: r = 0.16, p = 0.029), but a less consistent relation between trust in science and science knowledge (Studies 1: r = 0.29, p \textless{} .001; 2: r = 0.28, p \textless{} .001; 3: r = 0.14, p = 0.100; study 4: r = 0.10, p = 0.144).

Regarding H2, the results are mixed both for the relation between conspiracy beliefs (measured as the average acceptance of all the conspiracy beliefs) and acceptance of the scientific consensus (Studies 1: r = -0.33, p \textless{} .001; 2: r = -0.37, p \textless{} .001; 3: r = -0.02, p = 0.788; 4: r = -0.05, p = 0.498) as well as science knowledge (Studies 1: r = -0.38, p \textless{} .001; study 2: r = -0.40, p \textless{} .001; 3: r = -0.16, p = 0.055; 4: r = -0.02, p = 0.742).

Why did participants reject the scientific consensus? We got a total of 364 answers (study 2: 35; study 3: 74; study 4: 255) from 167 (study 2: 25; study 3: 47; study 4: 95) different participants to the open-ended questions on why they had rejected the scientific consensus on a particular question. Based on the answers, we created five categories. Table \ref{tab:justifications} summarizes these answers by five categories. All answers can be read in the OSM.

\end{table}

Why did participants accept the scientific consensus? In Studies 3 and 4--the vaccine skeptic samples--we had asked participants about cases where they agreed with the scientific consensus. A total of 320 (Study 3: 122; Study 4: 198) participants answered this question. There were more participants saying they accepted the scientific consensus because they independently verified the fact (Study 3: \texttt{exp3\_descriptives\$acceptance\_by\_reason{[}{[}"independent\ verification"{]}{]}\$share}; Study 4: 47\% ), than there were participants saying it was because they trust scientists (Study 3: 41.8\%; Study 4: 36.4\%). We asked participants who said they verified independently to explain how they did it (answers can be found in the ESM). 10.7\% in study 3 and 16.7\% in study 4 answered with other ``other'' and gave an open-ended explanation (see ESM).

In an exploratory analysis, we ran linear regressions to test whether there are differences between these two groups. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those who said they accepted consensus because of trust in scientists reported to trust science more (Study 3: mean = NA; \(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Trust}}\) = 0.19, = 0.330 on a scale from 1 to 4; Study 4: mean = 2.92; \(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Trust}}\) = 0.46, \textless{} .001) than those who said they verified independently (Study 3 mean = NA; Study 4 mean = 2.45). We did not find a difference regarding acceptance (Study 3: \(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Acceptance}}\) = 0.01, = 0.523 on a scale from 0 to 1; Study 4: \(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Acceptance}}\) = 0.04, = 0.116). In study 4, where we used facts that participants were unlikely to have encountered before, we tracked whether people clicked on the source links we provided--a behavior that you would expect from people who report verifying facts independently. On average, participants clicked only clicked on 1.36 links (out of 20 possible clicks) and there was no difference between the two groups (\(\hat{\beta}_{\text{Clicks}}\) = -1.09, = 0.062).

More detailed results addressing all our pre-registered research questions can be found in the OSM.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Survey data from the US suggests a decline of trust in science in recent years (Brian \& Tyson, 2023). Across the globe, many people only trust science `some of the time' , and a sizable minority doesn't trust it (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018, 2020). This appears difficult to reconcile with the fact that, in many countries, most people nowadays receive at least a basic education (Ritchie, Samborska, Ahuja, Ortiz-Ospina, \& Roser, 2023), and that science education has been found to be the most strongly associated variable with trust in science (Wellcome Global Monitor, 2018).

But how deep is distrust of science? In four studies, we have shown that almost every participant accepts almost all of basic science questions we included. Even when people do not know the correct answer to a science question, they tend to mostly accept the scientific consensus afterwards. That is true not only for basic science questions (studies 1-3), but also for more recent scientific findings that most people are unfamiliar with (study 4). In study 1 the acceptance rate after having given a wrong answer was considerably lower (23.7 \%) than in subsequent studies (study 2: 92.9 \%; study 3: 95.5 \%; study 4: 89.5 \%). While this could be just sampling variation, it might be that adding explanations and/or sources convinced participants more than merely stating the consensus. In general, participants with lower trust in science and who believe more in conspiracy theories tended to both know less about science and accept the scientific consensus less.

Scholars have long interpreted the lack of basic science knowledge as the root cause of distrust in and more generally unfavorable attitudes towards science, an explanation known under the term ``deficit-model'' (Durant et al., 1989; Miller, 1998, 2004). In line with proponents of the deficit-model, we find that people indeed err even on very basic science questions. However, we also find that almost everyone accepted the scientific consensus once informed about it. Moreover, the same was true for non-basic science questions. This calls into question the deficit model: If participants trust science on basic (and non-basic) questions---as suggests immediate acceptance of the scientific consensus---then unfavorable attitudes towards science must have other explanations than a mere lack of knowledge. This argument is supported by past research. In a seminal meta-analysis, @allumScienceKnowledgeAttitudes2008 found correlations between science knowledge and general attitudes towards science to be at best small and largely context dependent {[}@allumScienceKnowledgeAttitudes2008{]}. A more recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine states that science knowledge is ``unlikely to substantially affect attitudes on scientific issues'' (National Academies of Sciences, 2017).

How to make sense of the detachment of basic science knowledge from attitudes towards science? One explanation might be that most scientific findings are very abstract. For example, to most people, it will not be relevant for their daily lives to know that the speed of light is 299'792'458 meters per second. It is therefore easy to simply accept it, all the more if it appears to be consensual within the population of scientists. In other words, people might hold on to most scientific findings as reflective beliefs---beliefs that have little effect on our behaviors (Mercier, 2021). It is probably when it becomes tangible that science shape's people's attitudes. This can happen, for example, when science appears to support conclusions in favor of certain policies or moral positions, as for example in the case of anthropogenic climate change or vaccines.

It is tempting, especially for scientists, to explain mistrust in science with ignorance. After all, careful proof of objective truth is what makes science trustworthy---that is, for scientists. For most people, what shapes trust in science might not be so different from what shapes trust in other institutions, such as the government, banks or church.

\section{Experiment 1}\label{exp1}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-1}

We recruited 200 participants from the US via prolific. 6 participants failed our attention check, resulting in a final sample of 194 participants (98 female, 96 male; \(age_\text{mean}\): 41.71, \(age_\text{sd}\): 13.07, \(age_\text{median}\): 39). Since we did not have any prior assumptions on effect sizes, we did not do a power analysis.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Conspiracy scales}\label{conspiracy-scales}

Beside Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by Pennycook et al. (2022) which report in the main study, we also assessed two other consipiracy thinking measures:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) by Bruder et al. (2013):
  I think that . . .
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \ldots{} many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about. - politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.
\item
  \ldots{} government agencies closely monitor all citizens.
\item
  \ldots{} events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.
\item
  \ldots{} there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions.
\end{itemize}

{[}0\% - 100\%; 0 = certainly not, 100 = certain{]}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  The Single Item Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (SICBS) by Lantian et al. (2016) :
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I think that the official version of the events given by the authorities very often hides the truth. {[}1-9; 1 = Completely false, 5 = Unsure, 9 = Completely true{]}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Trust in science}\label{trust-in-science-2}

We rely on three items

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? {[}1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot{]}
\item
  In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? {[}1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot{]}
\item
  How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the public? {[}1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence{]}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}\label{results-1}

Regarding RQ1 and RQ2, participants answered on average 74 \% (sd = 0.16) of the questions correctly, and accepted the scientific consensus on average for 93 \% (sd = 0.12) of the questions.

Fig. \ref{fig:exp1-conditional-acceptance} illustrates the relationship between knowledge and acceptance. In most cases (76.3 \%), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus after having given the wrong answer to a question. In very few cases (1.6 \%), participants who gave the correct response afterwards rejected the scientific consensus, thereby contradicting their own initial response. We believe this might have been due to inattention.

For RQ3, we find a positive but small correlation between both science knowledge and trust in science (r = 0.29, p \textless{} .001), and acceptance of scientific consensus and trust in science (r = 0.27, p \textless{} .001). The more people are knowledgeable about science and the more they tend to accept the scientific consensus, the more they tend to trust science. These correlations are relatively weak, which might be partly due to ceiling effects: As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:exp1-plot}, (i) most people do trust science, and (ii) that is true even among people with low knowledge or acceptance rates.

For RQ4, we find a negative correlation of similar magnitude between conspiracy thinking and science knowledge (r = -0.38, p \textless{} .001), and conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus (r = -0.33, p \textless{} .001).

In Appendix \ref{exp1}, we show that these associations are robust when using alternative measures of trust and conspiracy thinking. Appendix \ref{exp1} also includes more descriptive statistics, such as knowledge and acceptance by science questions.

Are trust in science and conspiracy thinking, respectively, associated with being more easily convinced of the scientific consensus? In our main analyses, we looked at correlations of acceptance across all observations. One possibility is that the associations between trust in science/conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus are explained by science knowledge: People who give the right answer in the first place are more ready to accept the consensus, and trust in science/conspiracy thinking are mostly associated with this knowledge, but not with willingness to accept the consensus. To addressed this potential confound, in a non-preregistered analysis, we restricted our sample to cases where participants gave the wrong answer to the knowledge question. We then calculated the correlation between trust in science and average acceptance rate by participant. We find no statistically significant correlation of acceptance with neither conspiracy thinking (r = -0.14, p = 0.061), nor with trust in science (r = 0.06, p = 0.387).

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-1}

These results suggest that most people accept the scientific consensus most of the time. Even when people do not know the correct answer to a science question, they tend to mostly accept the scientific consensus afterwards. Yet, in 23.7 \% of the cases, participants rejected the scientific consensus after having given the wrong answer, suggesting that simply stating the consensus is not sufficient to convince participants sometimes. In general, people with lower trust in science and who believe more in conspiracy theories tend to both know less about science and accept the scientific consensus less.

\section{Experiment 2}\label{exp2}

In experiment 1, we tested whether participants would accept the scientific consensus on basic science facts. In most instances they did, but not always. In experiment 2, we wanted to test whether this reluctance was because of participants not trusting us as a source of consensual science knowledge. To do so, we added an explanation and sources to each consensus statement, instead of only stating the consensus. To better understand reasons for consensus rejection, after having answered all questions, we asked participants an open-ended question to explain why they rejected the consensus, for each question on which they did so. We also excluded the where do trees their materials from, as this question clearly seemed to be an outlier where most participants would get the answer wrong (see Appendix \ref{exp1}).

Based on experiment 1, we formulated the following hypotheses:

\textbf{H1a: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge?}

\textbf{H1b: Higher trust in science is associated with more acceptance of the scientific consensus, for participants who did not already know it?}

\textbf{H2a: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less science knowledge?}

\textbf{H2b: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less acceptance of the scientific consensus, for participants who did not already know it?}

We had the following research questions:

\textbf{RQ1: What is the average science knowledge score?}

\textbf{RQ2: When a participant's answer does not match the consensus, how often do they change their mind and accept the consensus?}

\textbf{RQ3: What reasons do participants provide to justify their rejection of the scientific consensus?}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-2}

We recruited 201 participants from the US via prolific. 11 participants failed our attention check, resulting in a final sample of 190 participants (96 female, 94 male; \(age_\text{mean}\): 43.48, \(age_\text{sd}\): 12.25, \(age_\text{median}\): 42). Since we did not have any prior assumptions on effect sizes and our analyses were descriptive, we did not do a power analysis.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-1}

The procedure was the same as in experiment 1, with the difference that, instead of just stating the scientific consensus, participants were presented with a short explanation which we wrote, partly based on explanations generated by ChatGPT, and three links to authoritative sources supporting the answer (Fig. \ref{fig:exp2-stimulus-example}.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials-3}

We relied on the same items as in experiment 1. The only difference was that we removed the question on trees.

\caption{Example of a science question, the scientific consensus and corresponding explanation and sources.}\label{fig:exp2-stimulus-example}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}\label{results-2}

As in experiment 1, we find a positive but small correlation between science knowledge and trust in science (H1a: r = 0.28, p \textless{} .001) and a small negative correlation between science knowledge and conspiracy thinking (H2a: r = -0.40, p \textless{} .001). By contrast to experiment 1, we conditioned on initially false answers when looking at the relationship of consensus acceptance with trust in science and conspiracy thinking, respectively. For trust in science, we find no statistically significant correlation (r = 0.16, p = 0.051). For conspiracy thinking we find a small negative one (r = -0.22, p = 0.006).

Confirming results from experiment 1, we find that the more people are knowledgeable about science and the more they tend to accept the scientific consensus even when they are not that knowledgeable in science, the more they tend to trust science. These correlations are relatively weak, which might be partly due to ceiling effects: As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:exp2-plot}, (i) most people do trust science, and (ii) that is true even among people with low knowledge or acceptance rates. In Appendix \ref{exp2} we show that these results hold for our alternative measures of trust and conspiracy thinking. We also include more descriptive statistics, such as knowledge and acceptance by science questions.

Regarding RQ1, participants answered on average 79 \% (sd = 0.19) of the questions correctly, and accepted the scientific consensus on average for 98 \% (sd = 0.05) of the questions. Fig. \ref{fig:exp2-conditional-acceptance} illustrates the relationship between knowledge and acceptance. In response to RQ2, in most cases (92.9 \%), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus after having initially given the wrong answer to a question. In very few cases (0.5 \%), participants who gave the correct response afterwards rejected the scientific consensus, thereby contradicting their own initial response.

Religious Beliefs & 2.00 & 5.7\% & 2.00\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{threeparttable}
\end{center}

\end{table}

For RQ3, we got 35 answers from 25 different participants to the open-ended questions on why they had rejected the scientific consensus on a particular question. Table \ref{tab:exp2-justifications} summarizes these answers by five categories. All answers can be read in Appendix \ref{exp2}.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion-2}

Similar to experiment 1, most people (i) do know and agree with the scientific consensus, and (ii) tend to accept the scientific consent even if they were not previously aware of it (i.e.~answered the knowledge question wrongly). The share of these latter is considerably larger in experiment 2 (92.9 \%) than in experiment 1 (76.3 \%). While this could be just sampling variation, it might be that adding explanations and sources convinced people more than merely stating the consensus. We also show, again, that people with lower trust in science and who believe more in conspiracy theories tend to both know less about science and accept the scientific consensus less.

\section{Experiment 3}\label{exp3}

Study 3 is essentially a replication-\/--with some minor modifications-\/--of study 2, but on a different type of sample. Both study 1 and 2 were run on convenience samples. For study 3, we recruited a sample of people holding anti-vaccination beliefs (see below). By contrast to study 2, after asking participants an open question about why they did not accept the consensus (in cases where they didn't), we provide them with an explicit opportunity to change their answer (Fig. \ref{fig:exp3-explanation-example}). Based on the answers to the open-ended questions, we also pre-registered a categorization scheme of reasons why people rejected the consensus. Finally, we also ask participants about why they agree with the scientific consensus on certain questions, in case they do. We want to know if participants perceive that this is because of trust, or other factors.

As for study 2 (but without conditioning on wrong answers, as we did in study 1), we had the following hypotheses:

\textbf{H1a: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge?}

\textbf{H1b: Higher trust in science is associated with more acceptance of the scientific consensus.}

\textbf{H2a: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less science knowledge?}

\textbf{H2b: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less acceptance of the scientific consensus.}

We had the following research questions:

\textbf{RQ1: What is the average science knowledge score?}

\textbf{RQ2: What is the average acceptance of the scientific consensus}

\textbf{RQ3: What reasons do participants provide to justify their rejection of the scientific consensus?}

\textbf{RQ4: In case they agree with the scientific consensus, do people feel that this is because of trust?}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-3}

We recruited a sample of participants holing vaccine-skeptic beliefs. Prolific Academic allows to filter out participants who have given specific answers to certain questions. We selected three available questions: 1. ``Participants were asked the following question: Please describe your attitudes towards the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) vaccines: {[}For (I feel positively about the vaccines); Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines); Neutral (I don't have strong opinions either way); Prefer not to say''{]}. We selected particpants who answered''Against''. 2. ``Participants were asked the following question: Have you received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination? {[}Yes (at least one dose); No; Prefer not to answer{]}''. We select only people who answered ``No''. 3. ``Participants were asked the following question: On a scale from 1-7, please rate to what extent you agree with the following statement: I believe that scheduled immunizations are safe for children. {[}1 (TOTALLY DISAGREEE); 2 (DISAGREE); 3 (SOMEWHAT DISAGREE); 4 (NEITHER AGREE NOR DISAGREE); 5 (SOMEWHAT AGREE); 6 (AGREE); 7 (TOTALLY AGREE); Rather not say''{]}. We select only people who answered''1'', ``2'', or ``3''.

Based on these criteria, we recruited 200 participants from the US via prolific, of which none failed our attention check, resulting in a final sample of 200 participants (125 female, 73 male; \(age_\text{mean}\): 42.90, \(age_\text{sd}\): 12.00, \(age_\text{median}\): 41). Since we did not have any prior assumptions on effect sizes and our analyses were descriptive, we did not do a power analysis.

However, due to a randomization mistake for our outcomes, participant answered only two of the three outcome measure blocs (trust in science, conspiracy thinking, and reason for accepting consensus). This leaves us with reduced sample sizes for all analyses concerning these outcomes (N = 140 for trust in science, N = 138 for conspiracy measures, N = 122 for reason for accepting consensus).

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-2}

The procedure was mostly the same as in experiment 2. In addition, after each open-ended question on cases where participants rejected the scientific consensus, participants were also asked if they want to change their answer and accept the scientific consensus. Finally, at the end of the survey, we asked participants: ``For the questions in which you agreed with the scientific consensus, would you say that\ldots?'' The answer options were: (i) ``You mostly agree with the consensus because, on that question, you trust scientists'', (ii) ``You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently verify it'', and (iii) ``Other'', with a text box for participants to explain. Participants who selected ``You mostly agree with the consensus because you have been able to independently verify it'', were asked the open-ended follow-up question: ``Could you please tell us how you independently verified the information?''.

\midrule
1 & Do antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria? & There is a consensus among scientists that antibiotics kill bacteria, but not viruses. & Antibiotics specifically target and kill bacteria, not viruses. Scientists know this thanks to extensive laboratory experiments and clinical trials where antibiotics have been observed to be effective against bacterial infections but not viral ones. Scientists have also studied how antibiotics work, which typically involve disrupting bacterial cell processes like cell wall synthesis or protein production, which are absent in viruses.

Here are some resources confirming that antibiotics only kill bacteria:

2 & Are electrons smaller, larger, or the same size as atoms ? & There is a consensus among scientists that electrons are smaller than atoms. & Electrons are much smaller than atoms. Scientists know this thanks to experiments in particle physics, such as electron scattering experiments. They are also able to measure the electron charge and mass. Additionally, atomic theory and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical framework explaining the structure of atoms, where electrons orbit the nucleus in distinct energy levels.

3 & Have the continents on Earth been moving for millions of years or have they always been where they are now? & There is a consensus among scientists that the continents on Earth have been moving for millions of years due to plate tectonics. & The continents on Earth have been moving for millions of years due to plate tectonics. Scientists have gathered evidence from various sources, including fossil records, geological formations, and the magnetic properties of rocks. The theory of plate tectonics explains how the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large, rigid plates that move over the semi-fluid asthenosphere, leading to phenomena like continental drift, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.

Here are some resources confirming that continents on Earth have been moving for millions years:

4 & What decides whether a baby is a boy or a girl ? Is it the fatherâ€™s genes, the motherâ€™s genes, or both? & There is a consensus among scientists that it is the genes in the father's sperm which are decisive on whether a baby is a boy or a girl. & Chromosomes are structures found in the nucleus of cells that carry long pieces of DNA. Two of the chromosomes (the X and the Y chromosome) are called sex chromosomes. In most cases, females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. At conception, the mother transmits an X chromosome, and the father may contribute an X or a Y. The chromosome from the father therefore determines if the baby is female (if the father transmits an X) or male (if the father transmits a Y). In most cases, children are born a male or female according to their chromosomes. However, some children may be born with genitalia that do not match their chromosomes.

Here are some resources confirming that it is the father's genes that decide the sex of a baby:

5 & Do lasers work by focusing sound waves? & There is a consensus among scientists that lasers do not work by focusing sound waves. & Lasers produce a narrow beam of light in which all of the particles of light have very similar wavelengths. The laserâ€™s lightwaves travel together with their peaks all lined up, in phase. This is why laser beams are very narrow, very bright, and can be focused into a very tiny spot. Because laser light stays focused and does not spread out much (like a flashlight would), laser beams can travel very long distances.

6 & How long does it take for Earth to go around the sun: one day, one month, or one year ? & There is a consensus among scientists that it takes one year for Earth to go around the sun. & Earth takes approximately one year to orbit the sun. This knowledge is based on astronomical observations and measurements of celestial motion. Early astronomers tracked the movement of the Earth relative to the stars and planets, leading to the development of models that accurately predict the Earth's orbital period around the sun.

Here are some resources confirming that Earth goes around the sun in one year:

7 & Are diamonds made of carbon ? & There is a consensus among scientists that diamonds are made of carbon. & Diamonds are made of only one element, carbon. Carbon is the same element that makes coal or graphite used for pencils. Why are diamonds transparent and hard while coal and graphite are opaque and soft? It all comes down to the placement of their atoms. In diamonds, each carbon atom is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms, while in graphite, each atom is only bonded to 3 other carbon atoms. The bonds in diamonds are held in such a tight structure that all light passes around them, which is why diamonds look transparent. In coal and graphite, light gets trapped between the atoms, which is why they look dark and opaque. Why do carbon atoms bond differently in diamonds? At very high pressures and temperatures, the carbon atoms are squeezed so much that they start touching more atoms. When the pressure is about 50,000 times the pressure at the surface of the Earth and the temperature is about 1600Â°C, the carbon atoms bond with 4 other atoms and result in diamonds.

Here are some resources confirming that diamonds are made of carbon:

8 & Which travels faster : light or sound? & There is a consensus among scientists that light travels faster than sound. & Light travels faster than sound. This conclusion arises from numerous experiments and observations in physics. You can also experience this for yourself during a thunderstorm. Unless the lighting is right above you, you will first see the lighting, then hear the thunder some time after (you can even tell how far the lighting struck by counting how many seconds it takes for the thunder to reach you). More precisely, the speed of light has been measured accurately using techniques such as the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment. Similarly, the speed of sound has been measured through experiments involving the propagation of sound waves through various materials.

9 & Is common table salt made of calcium carbonate? & There is a consensus among scientists that common table salt is not made of calcium carbonate; it is made of sodium chloride. & Common table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is not made of calcium carbonate. Scientists can use a variety of tests to understand what matter is made of. The most used test for sodium chloride is the chemical reaction with silver nitrate. The presence of sodium chloride yields a white precipitate upon drops of a silver nitrate solution. Calcium carbonate, by contrast, is the substance that makes up, for instance, chalk.

10 & Is water made of molecules containing one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms? & There is a consensus among scientists that water is made of molecules containing one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, and that its chemical formula is therefore H2O. & Water is made of molecules containing one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, chemically represented as H2O. We know this for instance because if you set hydrogen on fire in a container with oxygen, water will form on the sides of the container. More recent techniques such as spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography have allowed scientists to more directly see the composition and structure of water molecules, confirming the presence of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-3}

As in study 1 and 2, we find that participants answered on average 75 \% (sd = 0.18) of the questions correctly (RQ1), and initially accepted the scientific consensus on average for 96 \% (sd = 0.08) of the questions (RQ2). The acceptance rate is even higher when accounting for opinion revisions towards acceptance of the consensus, after initial rejection (98 \%, sd = 0.06).

Fig. \ref{fig:exp3-conditional-acceptance} illustrates the relationship between knowledge and acceptance. In most cases (87 \%), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus right after having given the wrong answer to a question. After providing the chance to revise the initial consensus rejection, this share is even larger (95.5 \%). In very few cases (0.9 \%), participants who initially gave the correct response afterwards rejected the scientific consensus right after, thereby contradicting their own initial response. This share drops slightly after providing the chance to revise the initial consensus rejection (0.7 \%).

For all correlations, we include opinion revisions for measuring consensus acceptance. We find no statistically significant correlation between science knowledge and trust in science (r = 0.14, p = 0.100), but a samll positive correlation between acceptance of scientific consensus and trust in science (r = 0.20, p = 0.019). Again, these findings might be partly due to ceiling effects: As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:exp3-plot}, (i) most people do trust science, and (ii) that is true even among people with low knowledge or acceptance rates. We find no statistically significant correlation between conspiracy thinking and science knowledge (r = -0.16, p = 0.055), and between conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus (r = -0.02, p = 0.788).

For RQ3, we got 74 answers from 47 different participants to the open-ended questions on why they had rejected the scientific consensus on a particular question. Table \ref{tab:exp3-justifications} summarizes these answers by five categories.

All answers can be read in the appendix.

\end{table}

For RQ4, we had 122 participants answering the question. Of these 41.8\% said they accepted the scientific consensus because they trust scientists on this question, while 47.5\% said they independently verified the fact. 10.7\% answered with other ``other'' and gave an open-ended explanation (see below for all open-ended answers).

We also asked all 58 participants who answered that they had independently verified the answer to explain how they did so. The open-ended answers are listed below.

\section{Experiment 4}\label{exp4}

Study 4 relies on broadly the same design as study 3, and is again run on a sample of participants with vaccine-skeptic beliefs. The main difference is that study 4 uses a set of science questions which, instead of being on well-established facts, we are about more recent discoveries (Table \ref{tab:exp4-knowledge}). Our main question is whether participants will nevertheless readily accept the scientific consensus, as they did for the basic facts in previous studies.

As for the previous studies, we had the following hypotheses:

\textbf{H1a: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge?}

\textbf{H1b: Higher trust in science is associated with more acceptance of the scientific consensus.}

\textbf{H2a: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less science knowledge?}

\textbf{H2b: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with less acceptance of the scientific consensus.}

We had the following research questions:

\textbf{RQ1: What is the average science knowledge score?}

\textbf{RQ2: What is the average acceptance of the scientific consensus}

\textbf{RQ3: What reasons do participants provide to justify their rejection of the scientific consensus?}

\textbf{RQ4: In case they agree with the scientific consensus, do people feel that this is because of trust?}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants-4}

We recruited a sample of participants holing vaccine-skeptic beliefs. Prolific Academic allows to filter out participants who have given specific answers to certain questions. We selected three available questions: 1. ``Participants were asked the following question: Please describe your attitudes towards the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) vaccines: {[}For (I feel positively about the vaccines); Against (I feel negatively about the vaccines); Neutral (I don't have strong opinions either way); Prefer not to say''{]}. We selected particpants who answered''Against''. 2. ``Participants were asked the following question: Have you received a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination? {[}Yes (at least one dose); No; Prefer not to answer{]}''. We select only people who answered ``No''. 3. ``Participants were asked the following question: On a scale from 1-7, please rate to what extent you agree with the following statement: I believe that scheduled immunizations are safe for children. {[}1 (TOTALLY DISAGREEE); 2 (DISAGREE); 3 (SOMEWHAT DISAGREE); 4 (NEITHER AGREE NOR DISAGREE); 5 (SOMEWHAT AGREE); 6 (AGREE); 7 (TOTALLY AGREE); Rather not say''{]}. We select only people who answered''1'', ``2'', or ``3''.

Based on these criteria, we recruited 200 participants from the US via prolific, of which two failed our attention check, resulting in a final sample of 198 participants (98 female, 100 male; \(age_\text{mean}\): 42.67, \(age_\text{sd}\): 12.32, \(age_\text{median}\): 41). Since we did not have any prior assumptions on effect sizes and our analyses were descriptive, we did not do a power analysis.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure-3}

The procedure was identical to the one in experiment 3.

\subsection{Results}\label{results-4}

By contrast to previous studies on basic science knowledge, participants on average answered only 36 \% (sd = 0.17) of the questions correctly (RQ1). Similar with previous studies, however, they initially accepted the scientific consensus on average for 86 \% (sd = 0.18) of the questions (RQ2). The acceptance rate is even higher when accounting for opinion revisions towards acceptance of the consensus, after initial rejection (91 \%, sd = 0.16).

Fig. \ref{fig:exp4-conditional-acceptance} illustrates the relationship between knowledge and acceptance. In most cases (83.7 \%), participants readily accepted the scientific consensus right after having given the wrong answer to a question. After providing the chance to revise the initial consensus rejection, this share is even larger (89.5 \%). In few (but still perhaps surprisingly many) cases (8.6 \%), participants who initially gave the correct response afterwards rejected the scientific consensus right after, thereby contradicting their own initial response. This share drops slightly after providing the chance to revise the initial consensus rejection (5.7 \%).

For all correlations, we include opinion revisions for measuring consensus acceptance. We find no statistically significant correlation between science knowledge and trust in science (r = 0.10, p = 0.144), but a small positive correlation between acceptance of scientific consensus and trust in science (r = 0.16, p = 0.029). Again, these findings might be partly due to ceiling effects: As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:exp4-plot}, (i) most people do trust science, and (ii) that is true even among people with low knowledge or acceptance rates. We do not find a statistically significant correlation between neither conspiracy thinking and science knowledge (r = -0.02, p = 0.742), nor between conspiracy thinking and acceptance of scientific consensus (r = -0.05, p = 0.498).

For RQ3, we got 255 answers from 95 different participants to the open-ended questions on why they had rejected the scientific consensus on a particular question. Table \ref{tab:exp4-justifications} summarizes these answers by five categories.

All answers can be read in the appendix.

For RQ4, only 36.4\% of participants said they accepted the scientific consensus because they trust scientists on this question, while 47\% said they independently verified the fact. 16.7\% answered with other ``other'' and gave an open-ended explanation (see below for all open-ended answers).

We also asked all 93 participants who answered that they had independently verified the answer to explain how they did so. The open-ended answers are listed below.

14 & cloning & I didn't think that many mice are actually cloned.\\
16 & orbit & I don't believe the Earth orbits the Sun.\\
16 & material & Nothing but their hypotheses without real evidence.\\
16 & magnetic & I'm not convinced the Earth existed 3.7 billion years ago.\\
23 & vertebrate & I don't believe in this kind of carbon dating. We can only slightly estimate the age, therefore I highly doubt the exact number of 392 years is accurate.\\
\addlinespace
23 & material & Earth is not billions of years old. At most, maybe 10,000 years. There is absolutely no way anything on Earth is billions of years old.\\
23 & magnetic & There was no magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago because the Earth was formed only around 6,000-10,000 years ago.\\
24 & cloning & I think it's less than that percentage\\
26 & vertebrate & no, just a guess\\
26 & brain & I have no idea.\\
\addlinespace
26 & material & No Idea\\
28 & material & I really could not explain this\\
28 & cloning & No, I could not explain this either\\
29 & orbit & Not enough science to prove.\\
29 & material & How can anyone put an  that age on something? Humans were not around the track.\\
\addlinespace
29 & cloning & Do not believe that anything can be cloned 100\%\\
32 & drug & Science is not always accurate.\\
32 & planet & N/A\\
32 & vertebrate & That doesn't seem accurate.\\
32 & brain & No.\\

42 & brain & There was a difference between what wiki said and the other article.\\
43 & vertebrate & I did not see anything to support this answer.\\
43 & brain & I did not feel like this was the correct answer.\\
\addlinespace
43 & material & Based on the article, I did not see this stated.\\
43 & cloning & There was nothing stated to prove this.\\
44 & vertebrate & I donâ€™t see how it is possible to know the oldest vertebrate when there are so many species out there undiscovered\\
44 & brain & I donâ€™t think I can explain it differently because Iâ€™m not an expert in science\\
44 & orbit & I am unsure if I can explain it differently, but how would we know if it never happened?\\
\addlinespace
44 & cloning & Again, this is a very detailed scientific question. I feel it so I will have to have extensive knowledge to answer this or I would have to have done an experiment on my own to to know this.\\
45 & drug & I am sure I heard it was used for malaria.\\
45 & cloning & I am not sure cloning is a definite technique.\\
49 & material & Religious reasons.\\
49 & magnetic & Religious reasons.\\
\addlinespace
54 & vertebrate & did not know the answer\\
54 & brain & did not know the answer\\
58 & cloning & The success rate just seems too high.\\
59 & vertebrate & The websites I read, seemed to have disagreed, unless I may have misread what I was fact checking.\\
60 & vertebrate & No.\\
\addlinespace
60 & orbit & No.\\
63 & planet & I don't know, but in my opinion when you are talking distance from star that is unknowable.\\
63 & vertebrate & I was guessing.  But knowing age via carbon dating is just guessing as well\\
63 & brain & I was guessing.  Same answer as others.\\
63 & boson & I was guessing.  But same answer.  They pretend to know things that are unknowable.\\
\addlinespace
63 & orbit & I was guessing.  Same answer as others.  Unknowable\\
63 & material & I was guessing.  This again is something unknowable.\\
63 & speed & I was guessing.  This is unknowable.\\
63 & magnetic & I was guessing.  This is unknowable.\\
65 & vertebrate & I couldnâ€™t locate the proof\\
\addlinespace
65 & speed & The proof wasnâ€™t clear to me\\
65 & cloning & Didnâ€™t see the info to back this up\\
67 & material & Just a guess, I didn't think it made sense.\\
67 & speed & Figured it was the speed of light, turns out I was close.\\
68 & orbit & I'm not really able to give an explanation\\
\addlinespace
68 & speed & not really\\
68 & cloning & Not really\\
69 & orbit & It didn't make sense to me at the time.\\
69 & cloning & I thought it was easier to clone mice\\
70 & orbit & these were hypothesis on the ones i got wrong.\\
\addlinespace
70 & speed & it was a hypothesis, i had no idea\\
70 & magnetic & it was a hypothesis i had no clue\\
72 & drug & I do not believe in this consensus since it usually is fabricated\\
72 & vertebrate & This is usually fabricated\\
72 & brain & This is normally a fabricated fact\\
\addlinespace
72 & boson & This is probably fabricated\\
72 & orbit & I do not agree with nearly scientific fact since it is made up\\
72 & material & This is probably made up\\
72 & speed & I do think this consensus is faked\\
72 & magnetic & these are all made up terms\\
\addlinespace
74 & vertebrate & Because there was not evidence that I understood to support this theory.\\
74 & brain & Because the research that was provided does not fully support this theory.\\
74 & boson & Because the research that I read did not support our object this statement.\\
74 & orbit & The research that was credited does not give a direct amount of time just a formula to get the answer.\\
74 & material & I disagree with this statement because the research that was given says 4.6 GA years old not more than.\\
\addlinespace
74 & speed & I disagree because there are not enough facts to support this claim.\\
75 & orbit & Looking at the website given, I could not find the exact time of how long the Earth would keep orbiting, so I didn't agree.\\
75 & speed & I could not find the answer to that in the given websites\\
75 & cloning & I could not find data that supported that percentage.\\
78 & material & No, Just a thought.\\
\addlinespace
78 & cloning & Just a random thought\\
79 & orbit & N/A\\
80 & vertebrate & I actually meant to press agree after reading the wikipedia , it had mentioned how the oldest 'recorded' vertebrate was 392 years old\\
81 & drug & Malaria sounds more like the answer to this question, since it was developed more recently.\\
81 & brain & This question I have no idea. But I would be willing to answer differently if needed.\\
\addlinespace
81 & orbit & The Earth would still keep its orbit if the sun disappeared. I believe it would still take 365 days to do one full orbit on its axis.\\
83 & material & The Bible says the Earth is 6000 years old\\
84 & material & From a biblical perspective, this is not the case. Other than that, no.\\
87 & vertebrate & No, I was just guessing.\\
87 & speed & No. I was just guessing.\\
\addlinespace
88 & planet & God hasn't created stars that are millions of miles away from Earth or each other.\\
88 & orbit & God created the Earth as flat and stationary!\\
88 & material & God created the Earth 6,000 years ago.\\
88 & magnetic & God created the Earth 6,000 years ago.\\
92 & cloning & I feel that they've been cloning people with pretty great success for some time now.\\
\addlinespace
92 & magnetic & Because I don't agree that the earth is billions years old, since I'm a Christian.\\
93 & material & There is no way for man to know if it was actually formed on earth or if it was formed somewhere else and then ended up on earth.\\
94 & boson & I agree\\
94 & cloning & The articles I read were quite vague but all stated the success of cloning mice has been incredibly low, which made me disagree with the consensus\\
96 & orbit & I felt if the Sun disappeared than the Earth orbiting would be fast than 8 minutes.\\
\addlinespace
96 & speed & I would like to change my answer to agree.\\
96 & cloning & I would like to change my answer to agree.\\
97 & material & How do they know how old anything is?.  Everything we have been told by the powers that be for our whole lives has been a lie.  It is hard to believe anything anymore.\\
98 & speed & I was not able to find that information in the reference material.\\
98 & cloning & I was not able to find that answer in the reference material. And I guess I have a deep distrust of scientists, as well. Even if I read something that a scientist said on Wikipedia or Google I would not believe it. Remember it was the scientists who said safe and effective. And the Nazis have been cloning people since the 30s, so why believe anything they say about cloning mice.\\
\addlinespace
104 & vertebrate & It was just a guess.\\
104 & brain & It was just a guess.\\
104 & boson & It was just a guess.\\
104 & speed & It was just a guess.\\
105 & drug & I am unfamiliar.\\

105 & orbit & Again I have no knowledge. It was a guess\\
106 & planet & Not sure I took a guess\\
106 & vertebrate & Not sure I took a guess\\
106 & brain & Not sure I took a guess\\
106 & material & Not sure I took a guess\\
\addlinespace
108 & material & I donâ€™t trust the sources as anyone can make changes\\
113 & vertebrate & Because I dont think they really know themselves\\
113 & material & The earth has only been around a short time and it thousands not millions or billions of years\\
113 & magnetic & No dont believe the bible is the true map of mans existance and its not billions of years old\\
114 & planet & I tried to research it and didnt find the answer so i just chose anything\\
\addlinespace
114 & vertebrate & I just chose an answer because I didn't know\\
114 & material & I just chose anything because I didn't know the answer\\
114 & cloning & I just chose anything because I didn't know the answer\\
115 & vertebrate & It said the oldest known vertebrate was 252 years old\\
115 & speed & I didnâ€™t see anywhere in the articles that backs this claim.\\
\addlinespace
118 & vertebrate & Aren't dinosaur bones older than 392 years old?\\
119 & material & If I understood the resources correctly I thought the time period was less. I'm questioning my answer now though!\\
121 & vertebrate & one of the articles i looked at said it was a smaller number I can't remember the number.\\
121 & material & I don't believe the earth is that old.\\
121 & cloning & I am not completely sure.  the number just seemed very large and I think that many of them die during the process.\\
\addlinespace
121 & magnetic & I'm not sure.  I still do not believe that the Earth is that old.\\
122 & speed & When reading the material that were given, I could not find the answer to confirm it. Therefore, since I could not confirm it, I did not accept the scientific consensus.\\
124 & planet & I didn't really understand the information on this one.\\
124 & boson & While reading the information provided I didn't see exact confirmation on if it has an electric charge or not.\\
124 & material & The answer was vague and not exact it just said more than 4 billion but not more than 4.6 billion.\\
\addlinespace
128 & drug & Because I thought it was the answer I had out.\\
128 & planet & Itâ€™s that far away.\\
128 & vertebrate & It shows that it was correct\\
128 & brain & Because of what I read.\\
128 & orbit & I had read it wrong.\\
\addlinespace
130 & brain & Neurons are everywhere.  I assumed that glials cells were not as prevalent as neurons.\\
130 & cloning & It was hard to believe science had progressed that much regarding cloning.  Cloning brings to mind science in the far future.\\
132 & orbit & I don't have anything scientifically to offer other than I just don't believe that's true.\\
133 & brain & I remember briefly coming across information on this subject and at the time they were thing they out numbered them 10.1. however that could of changed the more research that was done.\\
133 & cloning & i just assumed that cloning would not have a high success rate from reading about years ago, but I assume things have changed.\\
\addlinespace
134 & planet & I do not believe we can measure the distance of stars.\\
134 & orbit & I took a guess because I do not believe we can predict such a thing.\\
134 & material & I do not believe the earth is that old.\\
136 & cloning & Iâ€™m not sure that I believe that they are that successful.\\
137 & material & Not enough scientific proof\\
\addlinespace
137 & cloning & I don't believe in cloning techniques\\
137 & magnetic & It's possible that the earth magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago was 15 micro Tesla\\
139 & planet & I misread and thought they were talking about the distant from earth to Kepler.\\
139 & brain & It depends on the area of the brain and there could be some differences depending on which brains you are looking at.\\
139 & magnetic & I just wasn't sure.\\
\addlinespace
140 & vertebrate & No.\\
140 & brain & No\\
140 & material & No\\
140 & cloning & No\\
143 & planet & I don't trust that astronomers can accurately measure this.\\
\addlinespace
143 & vertebrate & I don't trust carbon 14 dating. I don't know what bomb-pusle is.\\
143 & orbit & I don't trust that scientists can estimate this accurately.\\
143 & material & I don't trust that scientists have a way to measure this accurately.\\
143 & magnetic & I don't trust that scientists have a way to measure this accurately.\\
145 & magnetic & i cant explain why i answered differently i probably forgot\\
\addlinespace
151 & boson & In some theoretical models or speculative physics, there might be hypotheses about different properties of the Higgs boson.\\
151 & speed & The exact percentage of the speed of light can vary slightly depending on the specific conditions and the state of the accelerator at any given time. Precision in reporting such values is crucial.\\
151 & cloning & The success rate might also depend on the specific strain of mice used or the conditions under which the cloning was performed. Variations in experimental conditions can affect the reported success rates.\\
152 & boson & Neutrality is a toxic line of thinking and only establishes constraints\\
152 & material & Universe is very old yes\\
\addlinespace
152 & speed & LHC is not what they say is it\\
152 & cloning & "sucess" for one thing but also this is vague and doesn't really say much\\
152 & magnetic & No way to really know this for sure and it also doesnt matter much\\
153 & orbit & I think if the sun disappeared the gravitational field would disappear nearly immediately; and the Earth would continue on in a straight line.\\
154 & orbit & I accept the scientific consensus but I do not accept Wikipedia as a confirming source of scientific data.\\
\addlinespace
154 & material & I don't have an explanation as to why I answered differently.\\
154 & speed & I thought from memory of my previous reading that my answer was correct.\\
155 & planet & I believe that there is not a way to accurately measure such a thing\\
155 & vertebrate & I believe that a lot of scientists make up numbers and the numbers aren't even accurate\\
155 & brain & This one might be accurate but I just wanted to disagree because I feel like it might not be accurate\\
\addlinespace
155 & orbit & I believe that a lot of those things about the Earth orbiting and stuff like that are misunderstood and not true\\
155 & material & I believe that the Earth is much younger than we're told and that allow those numbers about the Earth being trillions and trillions of years old is just crazy talk\\
155 & magnetic & I believe that the Earth does not have a magnetic field that's just a theory that is wrong in my opinion\\
157 & orbit & Sure, it's a prediction and one that doesn't sound very plausible to me.\\
157 & material & I don't believe the earth is that old.\\
\addlinespace
157 & magnetic & Once again, I don't believe the earth is that old.\\
159 & planet & Couldn't havesais it better myself\\
159 & material & No\\
163 & cloning & Because one of the links said 8 out of 10 success rate on cloning mice.\\
163 & magnetic & Because i didn't see anything showing that the researcher pulled samples from the northern most region to do the dating. There had been 2 other heating events that could have corrupted the data if they took it from the southern area.\\
\addlinespace
164 & orbit & I don't fully trust the sources and the Sun's never disappeared so how would they know.\\
167 & material & They are just guessing. There is no way to verify their estimates.\\
167 & magnetic & Earth age estimates are just guesses there is no way to verify them.\\
168 & planet & Scientific "Consensus" has low credibility in my perception.\\

169 & material & I don't think has to be that old.\\
171 & vertebrate & It did not sound right to me, and that science can be wrong too.\\
171 & cloning & I will agree with science on this one because they  create weird things.\\
172 & speed & I thought the article showed a different answer, but I looked back and read it again and confirmed the original statement is in fact true\\
\addlinespace
172 & cloning & I thought the article showed a different answer, but I looked back and read it again and confirmed the original statement is in fact true\\
173 & vertebrate & I think an older one has been found since 2016.\\
173 & brain & I think it is more likely there is a differing amount which may be very small but I really have no idea. I just know we humans are highly fallible and fallen and are wrong about things all the time.\\
173 & material & The Earth is no where near this old, it is around 6000-7000 years old. I cannot wait until we come to realize how utterly foolish we are in believing in the millions-billions or years old myth.\\
173 & magnetic & Same reason as above.\\
\addlinespace
174 & boson & The website was not convincing\\
174 & orbit & I thought it would be longer\\
175 & material & My final authority is the Bible.  It only goes back 6500 years to the creation.\\
175 & cloning & I just dont believe cloning techniques are that good my researched showed its around 1-2\%.\\
175 & magnetic & Earth was created around 6500 years ago.\\
\addlinespace
177 & material & I am a creationist and believe the earth is much younger than that and am not convinced the testing methods are correct\\
177 & cloning & number just seemed too high\\
181 & brain & There is a similar amount, but not the same amount.\\
181 & orbit & It's impossible to state as fact.\\
181 & material & It's impossible to state as fact.\\
\addlinespace
181 & magnetic & It's impossible to state as fact.\\
183 & planet & i read the distance in kilometers instead of miles.\\
183 & magnetic & i read that during this time the microteslas was 30-50\\
184 & vertebrate & Knowing how long vertebrates live today it seems unlikely that they lived significantly longer in the past\\
184 & material & There is so much variation when it comes to measuring the early days of earth that I would assume given enough time this estimate will change dramatically in the future\\

27 & After I was showed the answer, I copied and pasted in into search bar and looked at other sources.\\
\addlinespace
31 & I researched it on a fact checked website\\
33 & I looked up each question. I have to just trust it at some point to answer the survey, but there are some things I'm not going to trust the internet for.\\
34 & I dif a lot of research on some of the questions..\\
36 & just an educated guess\\
37 & Through painstakingly tiring, wikipedia combing and years of just generally being inquisitive\\
\addlinespace
38 & Do my own research times ten\\
40 & I went to a couple of the provided links\\
41 & i did not\\
42 & By clicking on the links provided and reading the information.\\
43 & I searched multiple sites.\\
\addlinespace
44 & I would have to conduct experiments sent independently, verify it or read trustworthy sources\\
45 & Some of the information I have heard before.\\
48 & By finding additional sources\\
49 & My own research.\\
50 & I go and read multiple articles or studies\\
\addlinespace
51 & Through study and resources.\\
52 & I have done extensive research, read books from the library, watched DVDs and verified the information. After my mom died from a brain tumor I've researched the cures for cancer for 20 years now and know that doctors who come up with a cure are jailed or murdered to keep the status quo of the cancer industry. It's upsetting what our own government did in the 911 attacks on our own country as well.\\
56 & There were 2 links shown to confirm the answers.  The references were from scientists as well.\\
58 & There's lots of evidence.\\
59 & I only quickly checked. I have a hard time following Science, as it is not something I find interesting. However, I do like to fact check things when possible, and when provoked to do so.\\
\addlinespace
60 & I verified the information by clicking the links provided and using critical reasoning.\\
65 & Using the websites probided\\
67 & I always like to fact check stuff because I don't necessarily believe things at face value.\\
71 & I independently verified some of it a long time ago\\
72 & By lots of reading, research, and logic common sense\\
\addlinespace
74 & I read the documents that were given myself\\
75 & Read the provide websites to find agreeable information, also quick searches provided some verifications.\\
76 & Wikepedia\\
77 & I didn't\\
79 & I used google. Which I would say is an elementary resource for information, but it was good for answering such questions\\
\addlinespace
82 & Non- mainstream media sources, government documents, intuition.\\
83 & Research on my own\\
86 & I researched on google.\\
87 & By the websites you listed.\\
95 & I knew some things and from personal opinions\\
\addlinespace
98 & I use the Brave browser. Less censorship.\\
101 & I checked online with various sources to make sure they were true\\
102 & Checking the websites provided\\
107 & you need to add questions about where scientists get there funding from, and whether or not we would trust a statement like, all scientists agree\\
108 & I just went with my gut\\
\addlinespace
111 & I like to read a lot from all sorts of different sources, then read arguments that disagree with them. Eventually I'll find a grain of truth in all of that and use pattern recognition to fill in gaps based on what I know.\\
114 & Just did a google search\\
115 & I read the articles.\\
116 & Though previous knowledge and research\\
117 & I clicked the links to read what was stated.\\
\addlinespace
118 & I did a quick look on Google and searched on my own\\
119 & Google and the resources shown during the study\\
120 & I do my own research.\\
121 & i used the links in the study and looked briefly, at the articles.  Didn't understand most of it but made best decision I could.\\
122 & I read the material that was given within each of the questions and found the information.\\
\addlinespace
123 & I checked various sources and informational circles\\
124 & I searched up the information and researched myself.\\
126 & I looked at the websites cited in the questions.\\
127 & did web searches\\
133 & Well not exactly verified , but Just things I have researched or came across while online. there is a lot of information out there and a lot of misinformation. You just have to take a side\\
\addlinespace
135 & doing research and reading articles and scientific studies.\\
136 & By clicking the links provided\\
137 & I somewhat trust scientist but overall, I independently do my own research to verify such existing's\\
138 & Did much research and corroborated each finding or information and lined up against each other to see similar outcomes.\\
139 & By looking up the links to reputable sources and seeing if they match up with what other reputable sources are saying.\\
\addlinespace
140 & Verified persons in specialized authority.\\
141 & I just do my own research and look into things and how they could or couldnâ€™t work\\
145 & i was informed  by trusted sources\\
147 & I checked the links given\\
154 & Online research of more trusted sources\\
\addlinespace
155 & Basically it aligns with other things I believe to be true so I will agree with it I'm not saying that I went out of my way and did a bunch of different studies but the thing about a lot of scientific research and studies if the foundation of the study is unstable or unreliable then I can't trust that a lot of the results are accurate\\
156 & I clicked on the articles and read for myself. Instead of trusting the information listed in the survey on its own I clicked the links to verify the information.\\
163 & i either knew the information or i followed the links provided and believed the information.\\
166 & I search multiple doctors and scientists and compare there work and theories\\
167 & I read research papers and look for inconsistencies or bad methodology.\\
\addlinespace
170 & Google search it\\
171 & I heard of these questions before, and I looked at the sources and my sources.\\
172 & I read the attached files to see if the info could be backed up on there as well. The 2 I thought I read as false I ended up doing a google search to confirm that the statements were in fact true\\
176 & I didnâ€™t but I will\\
179 & I research various sources that lean in either direction (left or right) as well as sources that appear, at least on the surface, to be impartial. After gathering all of this information, I make my informed decision.\\
\addlinespace
183 & asking ai such as chatgpt\\
184 & Through my own research and comparison to other studies and others research.\\
188 & I looked it up using the links provided to me.\\
191 & By clicking and reading the link\\
192 & I read the articles and found the actual answer to the question.\\
\addlinespace
194 & Online\\
195 & google and research\\
197 & With the references provided in the study.\\
