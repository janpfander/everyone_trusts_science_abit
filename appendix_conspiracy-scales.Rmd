# Conspiracy Measures {#exp1}

In addition to the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by @pennycookOverconfidentlyConspiratorialConspiracy2022 which report in the main study, we also assessed two other consipiracy thinking measures: The conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) by @bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013 and the Single Item Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (SICBS) by @lantianMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2016 (Table \@ref(tab:overview-conspiracy-measures)).
