5,By trying to remember
10,Curiosity and the internet
12,Guessed
14,"I double-checked the information on Google by looking up various websites, I did go with my initial gut instincts in most cases however if it was wrong upon verifying it then I would change my answer"
18,Prior knowledge from a formal education
19,I can check several different sources on the internet and see if they have the same verifiable information.
21,I use intuition.  I use common sense.
22,"I have read it before, and did some experiments in chemistry class.  I look for scientific consensus on everything.  On these long established principles, I could have selected both answers.  I believe sometimes scientists are bribed or exhibit bias depending on who is funding them and what answers the funding entity wants. COVID treatments were a big example of that.  Hospitals were paid to execute certain protocols and disallow others."
27,"Most of the questions, the consensus answer was the same as my answer. For the one or two questions where it was not, I looked at who their sources were for the answers, and decided whether I believed those sources and how unsure I was about my answer and made my decision from there."
31,Through exposure to scientific experiments and research that prove the claims valid and can be repeated with the same results occurring.
36,There is evidence and a good amount of understand about these issues. There isn't as much understanding when it comes to things like vaccines.
38,"Through many sources, including my own common sense and a lifetime of research into these matters."
39,I used the information that I have learned in school and in the past.
40,Most things I knew already as some were common knowledge
41,My gut instinct.
42,"Most was knowledge I already knew, however if I were to find out or look up info, I would simply consult the internet"
43,I thought about what i was told in school.
44,"I checked reliable sources, and I knew most of them from learning this information in science class."
48,some things are obvious and don't need verification
49,Research on my own as opposed to jist blindly following what the media is told to tell me.
56,extensive research
58,I verified it with what then knowledge I know
67,I remember some of the stuff from school.
68,I clicked on two out of three of the links for most statements that I was unsure about.
71,I have a lot of people who do deep research that verified the info.
77,Just various amounts of research online. There have been times where simple questions were simply ignored or answered in a perplexing manner. Those types of answers always raise a flag.
81,By  the knowledge I already had.
82,Some of these questions I remember from high school. And I learned this in science. Therefore I do remember alot of these questions.
88,I don't know
97,Either I already knew the information or after reading the information I can to my conclusion
98,"My wife has taken two different kinds of antibiotics, one for viral infections and one for bacterial infections"
100,I independently verified the information by doing a lot of research and comparing studies.
103,I do my own research.
114,I guess I haven't independently verified the information.
116,wikipedia articles and google searches
120,"The questions I got wrong were facts that I had simply forgotten. Once made aware of the correct answer, I remembered that it was in fact the correct answer."
122,heard of it before
123,I used the links provided and then googled the question if I was unsure
126,"It is an obvious pattern whenever these events happen that there is a coverup, you just have to research the track record"
129,"I'm unsure of which question, you asked several.  it's a bit confusing. the vaccine question has been verified by personal treatment and independent studies that were banned on social platforms"
131,I used the information and links given to verify it.
132,"I have been studying this information for many years. Real science is not consensus alone. Peer review is rigged and fraudulent. We are not being given the truth about many things and most ""scientists"" don't even know that they are wrong and refuse to reinvestigate the topics."
136,Have an educational background in anthropology and took a lot of science courses. I trust scientists generally but not always the way the findings are relayed.
137,"My own research, we were lied to in school"
144,By looking through multiple sources on a given topic.
152,"A lot of this I have already learned, but I can't personally verify it bc I can't run the tests."
154,I have done several science experiments to prove a lot of these ideas.
156,looking it up online from at least 2-3 sources
159,"Instead of taking what the mainstream talking point is and immediately accepting it, I like to do further research myself."
161,I already knew of the information presented to me for years.
163,I googled it and read information from various sources.
164,Many of these tidbits of information are taught as introduction to different subjects. I have either studied this or have used Google  Academic to verify.
178,"Some of the questions I've done my own research on, others I can see with my own eyes."
185,most of the questions i already knew the answer to because i researched it a long time ago
186,"The information presented is basic knowledge we learn throughout ours lives. Light travels faster than sound. The fathers genes decide whether ba baby will be male or female. Diamonds are formed from carbon. Calcium carbonate is not sodium chloride. It takes the earth 365.2ish to orbit our sun. Yes, water is 2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen. And and electron is much smaller than an atom. All things we learn in school. Oh and lasers use light waves not sound waves."
187,"For light traveling faster then sound it's obviously verifiable because you see lightning before you hear thunder, lasers are visible so obviously they are made of light not sound, the definition of water is H2O so if something isn't H2O then it isn't water.  The vast majority of the questions were extremely common sense if you think about them for any amount of time."
191,I either realized I was wrong or it sounded logical in my mind.
200,The Bible.
