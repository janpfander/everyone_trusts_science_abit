5,planet,I thought it was fake
6,magnetic,I dont believe the earth has been here 3.7 billion years
10,orbit,I honestly do not know anything about this stuff so i took a guess
10,cloning,I took a guess
12,material,seemed like too long of a time
14,cloning,I didn't think that many mice are actually cloned.
16,orbit,I don't believe the Earth orbits the Sun.
16,material,Nothing but their hypotheses without real evidence.
16,magnetic,I'm not convinced the Earth existed 3.7 billion years ago.
23,vertebrate,"I don't believe in this kind of carbon dating. We can only slightly estimate the age, therefore I highly doubt the exact number of 392 years is accurate."
23,material,"Earth is not billions of years old. At most, maybe 10,000 years. There is absolutely no way anything on Earth is billions of years old."
23,magnetic,"There was no magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago because the Earth was formed only around 6,000-10,000 years ago."
24,cloning,I think it's less than that percentage
26,vertebrate,"no, just a guess"
26,brain,I have no idea.
26,material,No Idea
28,material,I really could not explain this
28,cloning,"No, I could not explain this either"
29,orbit,Not enough science to prove.
29,material,How can anyone put an  that age on something? Humans were not around the track.
29,cloning,Do not believe that anything can be cloned 100%
32,drug,Science is not always accurate.
32,planet,N/A
32,vertebrate,That doesn't seem accurate.
32,brain,No.
32,boson,No.
32,orbit,No.
32,material,No.
32,cloning,No.
32,magnetic,No.
35,vertebrate,"No, because I just guessed."
35,orbit,"No, I just guessed."
35,material,No
41,planet,i guessed
41,vertebrate,i guessed
41,boson,i guessed
41,magnetic,i guessed
42,brain,There was a difference between what wiki said and the other article.
43,vertebrate,I did not see anything to support this answer.
43,brain,I did not feel like this was the correct answer.
43,material,"Based on the article, I did not see this stated."
43,cloning,There was nothing stated to prove this.
44,vertebrate,I don’t see how it is possible to know the oldest vertebrate when there are so many species out there undiscovered
44,brain,I don’t think I can explain it differently because I’m not an expert in science
44,orbit,"I am unsure if I can explain it differently, but how would we know if it never happened?"
44,cloning,"Again, this is a very detailed scientific question. I feel it so I will have to have extensive knowledge to answer this or I would have to have done an experiment on my own to to know this."
45,drug,I am sure I heard it was used for malaria.
45,cloning,I am not sure cloning is a definite technique.
49,material,Religious reasons.
49,magnetic,Religious reasons.
54,vertebrate,did not know the answer
54,brain,did not know the answer
58,cloning,The success rate just seems too high.
59,vertebrate,"The websites I read, seemed to have disagreed, unless I may have misread what I was fact checking."
60,vertebrate,No.
60,orbit,No.
63,planet,"I don't know, but in my opinion when you are talking distance from star that is unknowable."
63,vertebrate,I was guessing.  But knowing age via carbon dating is just guessing as well
63,brain,I was guessing.  Same answer as others.
63,boson,I was guessing.  But same answer.  They pretend to know things that are unknowable.
63,orbit,I was guessing.  Same answer as others.  Unknowable
63,material,I was guessing.  This again is something unknowable.
63,speed,I was guessing.  This is unknowable.
63,magnetic,I was guessing.  This is unknowable.
65,vertebrate,I couldn’t locate the proof
65,speed,The proof wasn’t clear to me
65,cloning,Didn’t see the info to back this up
67,material,"Just a guess, I didn't think it made sense."
67,speed,"Figured it was the speed of light, turns out I was close."
68,orbit,I'm not really able to give an explanation
68,speed,not really
68,cloning,Not really
69,orbit,It didn't make sense to me at the time.
69,cloning,I thought it was easier to clone mice
70,orbit,these were hypothesis on the ones i got wrong.
70,speed,"it was a hypothesis, i had no idea"
70,magnetic,it was a hypothesis i had no clue
72,drug,I do not believe in this consensus since it usually is fabricated
72,vertebrate,This is usually fabricated
72,brain,This is normally a fabricated fact
72,boson,This is probably fabricated
72,orbit,I do not agree with nearly scientific fact since it is made up
72,material,This is probably made up
72,speed,I do think this consensus is faked
72,magnetic,these are all made up terms
74,vertebrate,Because there was not evidence that I understood to support this theory.
74,brain,Because the research that was provided does not fully support this theory.
74,boson,Because the research that I read did not support our object this statement.
74,orbit,The research that was credited does not give a direct amount of time just a formula to get the answer.
74,material,I disagree with this statement because the research that was given says 4.6 GA years old not more than.
74,speed,I disagree because there are not enough facts to support this claim.
75,orbit,"Looking at the website given, I could not find the exact time of how long the Earth would keep orbiting, so I didn't agree."
75,speed,I could not find the answer to that in the given websites
75,cloning,I could not find data that supported that percentage.
78,material,"No, Just a thought."
78,cloning,Just a random thought
79,orbit,N/A
80,vertebrate,"I actually meant to press agree after reading the wikipedia , it had mentioned how the oldest 'recorded' vertebrate was 392 years old"
81,drug,"Malaria sounds more like the answer to this question, since it was developed more recently."
81,brain,This question I have no idea. But I would be willing to answer differently if needed.
81,orbit,The Earth would still keep its orbit if the sun disappeared. I believe it would still take 365 days to do one full orbit on its axis.
83,material,The Bible says the Earth is 6000 years old
84,material,"From a biblical perspective, this is not the case. Other than that, no."
87,vertebrate,"No, I was just guessing."
87,speed,No. I was just guessing.
88,planet,God hasn't created stars that are millions of miles away from Earth or each other.
88,orbit,God created the Earth as flat and stationary!
88,material,"God created the Earth 6,000 years ago."
88,magnetic,"God created the Earth 6,000 years ago."
92,cloning,I feel that they've been cloning people with pretty great success for some time now.
92,magnetic,"Because I don't agree that the earth is billions years old, since I'm a Christian."
93,material,There is no way for man to know if it was actually formed on earth or if it was formed somewhere else and then ended up on earth.
94,boson,I agree
94,cloning,"The articles I read were quite vague but all stated the success of cloning mice has been incredibly low, which made me disagree with the consensus"
96,orbit,I felt if the Sun disappeared than the Earth orbiting would be fast than 8 minutes.
96,speed,I would like to change my answer to agree.
96,cloning,I would like to change my answer to agree.
97,material,How do they know how old anything is?.  Everything we have been told by the powers that be for our whole lives has been a lie.  It is hard to believe anything anymore.
98,speed,I was not able to find that information in the reference material.
98,cloning,"I was not able to find that answer in the reference material. And I guess I have a deep distrust of scientists, as well. Even if I read something that a scientist said on Wikipedia or Google I would not believe it. Remember it was the scientists who said safe and effective. And the Nazis have been cloning people since the 30s, so why believe anything they say about cloning mice."
104,vertebrate,It was just a guess.
104,brain,It was just a guess.
104,boson,It was just a guess.
104,speed,It was just a guess.
105,drug,I am unfamiliar.
105,orbit,Again I have no knowledge. It was a guess
106,planet,Not sure I took a guess
106,vertebrate,Not sure I took a guess
106,brain,Not sure I took a guess
106,material,Not sure I took a guess
108,material,I don’t trust the sources as anyone can make changes
113,vertebrate,Because I dont think they really know themselves
113,material,The earth has only been around a short time and it thousands not millions or billions of years
113,magnetic,No dont believe the bible is the true map of mans existance and its not billions of years old
114,planet,I tried to research it and didnt find the answer so i just chose anything
114,vertebrate,I just chose an answer because I didn't know
114,material,I just chose anything because I didn't know the answer
114,cloning,I just chose anything because I didn't know the answer
115,vertebrate,It said the oldest known vertebrate was 252 years old
115,speed,I didn’t see anywhere in the articles that backs this claim.
118,vertebrate,Aren't dinosaur bones older than 392 years old?
119,material,If I understood the resources correctly I thought the time period was less. I'm questioning my answer now though!
121,vertebrate,one of the articles i looked at said it was a smaller number I can't remember the number.
121,material,I don't believe the earth is that old.
121,cloning,I am not completely sure.  the number just seemed very large and I think that many of them die during the process.
121,magnetic,I'm not sure.  I still do not believe that the Earth is that old.
122,speed,"When reading the material that were given, I could not find the answer to confirm it. Therefore, since I could not confirm it, I did not accept the scientific consensus."
124,planet,I didn't really understand the information on this one.
124,boson,While reading the information provided I didn't see exact confirmation on if it has an electric charge or not.
124,material,The answer was vague and not exact it just said more than 4 billion but not more than 4.6 billion.
128,drug,Because I thought it was the answer I had out.
128,planet,It’s that far away.
128,vertebrate,It shows that it was correct
128,brain,Because of what I read.
128,orbit,I had read it wrong.
130,brain,Neurons are everywhere.  I assumed that glials cells were not as prevalent as neurons.
130,cloning,It was hard to believe science had progressed that much regarding cloning.  Cloning brings to mind science in the far future.
132,orbit,I don't have anything scientifically to offer other than I just don't believe that's true.
133,brain,I remember briefly coming across information on this subject and at the time they were thing they out numbered them 10.1. however that could of changed the more research that was done.
133,cloning,"i just assumed that cloning would not have a high success rate from reading about years ago, but I assume things have changed."
134,planet,I do not believe we can measure the distance of stars.
134,orbit,I took a guess because I do not believe we can predict such a thing.
134,material,I do not believe the earth is that old.
136,cloning,I’m not sure that I believe that they are that successful.
137,material,Not enough scientific proof
137,cloning,I don't believe in cloning techniques
137,magnetic,It's possible that the earth magnetic field 3.7 billion years ago was 15 micro Tesla
139,planet,I misread and thought they were talking about the distant from earth to Kepler.
139,brain,It depends on the area of the brain and there could be some differences depending on which brains you are looking at.
139,magnetic,I just wasn't sure.
140,vertebrate,No.
140,brain,No
140,material,No
140,cloning,No
143,planet,I don't trust that astronomers can accurately measure this.
143,vertebrate,I don't trust carbon 14 dating. I don't know what bomb-pusle is.
143,orbit,I don't trust that scientists can estimate this accurately.
143,material,I don't trust that scientists have a way to measure this accurately.
143,magnetic,I don't trust that scientists have a way to measure this accurately.
145,magnetic,i cant explain why i answered differently i probably forgot
151,boson,"In some theoretical models or speculative physics, there might be hypotheses about different properties of the Higgs boson."
151,speed,The exact percentage of the speed of light can vary slightly depending on the specific conditions and the state of the accelerator at any given time. Precision in reporting such values is crucial.
151,cloning,The success rate might also depend on the specific strain of mice used or the conditions under which the cloning was performed. Variations in experimental conditions can affect the reported success rates.
152,boson,Neutrality is a toxic line of thinking and only establishes constraints
152,material,Universe is very old yes
152,speed,LHC is not what they say is it
152,cloning,"""sucess"" for one thing but also this is vague and doesn't really say much"
152,magnetic,No way to really know this for sure and it also doesnt matter much
153,orbit,I think if the sun disappeared the gravitational field would disappear nearly immediately; and the Earth would continue on in a straight line.
154,orbit,I accept the scientific consensus but I do not accept Wikipedia as a confirming source of scientific data.
154,material,I don't have an explanation as to why I answered differently.
154,speed,I thought from memory of my previous reading that my answer was correct.
155,planet,I believe that there is not a way to accurately measure such a thing
155,vertebrate,I believe that a lot of scientists make up numbers and the numbers aren't even accurate
155,brain,This one might be accurate but I just wanted to disagree because I feel like it might not be accurate
155,orbit,I believe that a lot of those things about the Earth orbiting and stuff like that are misunderstood and not true
155,material,I believe that the Earth is much younger than we're told and that allow those numbers about the Earth being trillions and trillions of years old is just crazy talk
155,magnetic,I believe that the Earth does not have a magnetic field that's just a theory that is wrong in my opinion
157,orbit,"Sure, it's a prediction and one that doesn't sound very plausible to me."
157,material,I don't believe the earth is that old.
157,magnetic,"Once again, I don't believe the earth is that old."
159,planet,Couldn't havesais it better myself
159,material,No
163,cloning,Because one of the links said 8 out of 10 success rate on cloning mice.
163,magnetic,Because i didn't see anything showing that the researcher pulled samples from the northern most region to do the dating. There had been 2 other heating events that could have corrupted the data if they took it from the southern area.
164,orbit,I don't fully trust the sources and the Sun's never disappeared so how would they know.
167,material,They are just guessing. There is no way to verify their estimates.
167,magnetic,Earth age estimates are just guesses there is no way to verify them.
168,planet,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,brain,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,boson,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,orbit,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,material,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,speed,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,cloning,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
168,magnetic,"Scientific ""Consensus"" has low credibility in my perception."
169,material,I don't think has to be that old.
171,vertebrate,"It did not sound right to me, and that science can be wrong too."
171,cloning,I will agree with science on this one because they  create weird things.
172,speed,"I thought the article showed a different answer, but I looked back and read it again and confirmed the original statement is in fact true"
172,cloning,"I thought the article showed a different answer, but I looked back and read it again and confirmed the original statement is in fact true"
173,vertebrate,I think an older one has been found since 2016.
173,brain,I think it is more likely there is a differing amount which may be very small but I really have no idea. I just know we humans are highly fallible and fallen and are wrong about things all the time.
173,material,"The Earth is no where near this old, it is around 6000-7000 years old. I cannot wait until we come to realize how utterly foolish we are in believing in the millions-billions or years old myth."
173,magnetic,Same reason as above.
174,boson,The website was not convincing
174,orbit,I thought it would be longer
175,material,My final authority is the Bible.  It only goes back 6500 years to the creation.
175,cloning,I just dont believe cloning techniques are that good my researched showed its around 1-2%.
175,magnetic,Earth was created around 6500 years ago.
177,material,I am a creationist and believe the earth is much younger than that and am not convinced the testing methods are correct
177,cloning,number just seemed too high
181,brain,"There is a similar amount, but not the same amount."
181,orbit,It's impossible to state as fact.
181,material,It's impossible to state as fact.
181,magnetic,It's impossible to state as fact.
183,planet,i read the distance in kilometers instead of miles.
183,magnetic,i read that during this time the microteslas was 30-50
184,vertebrate,Knowing how long vertebrates live today it seems unlikely that they lived significantly longer in the past
184,material,There is so much variation when it comes to measuring the early days of earth that I would assume given enough time this estimate will change dramatically in the future
188,vertebrate,No I am not able to explain my answer.
188,orbit,No.
192,vertebrate,Based on what I read it’s not true.
192,material,Based on what I read it’s not true.
192,speed,I’m not sure if it’s true because I couldn’t find the proof for the claim in the material.
192,cloning,I don’t know if it is true because I couldn’t find the proof in the material.
194,planet,It how I was taught.
194,boson,I don't know
195,planet,im a flat earther and i believe all the stars are right in our own atmosphere
195,orbit,i dont believe that the earth orbits around the sun at all to be honest i think the sun and moon travel over the earth
195,material,i dont believe that the earth is that old
195,magnetic,dont believe the earth is that old
197,orbit,I could not find the reference to corroborate the information.
197,material,The oldest material I found was just over 4.4 Ga
197,speed,I could not find the reference to corroborate the information.
