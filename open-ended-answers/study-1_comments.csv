79,"Should've clicked agree about plants getting carbon from the air, but I wanted to look it up first. Whenever I encounter something I didn't know online, I like to cross-reference. In retrospect though, everything else you asked about was simple and on the level, and I'm sure you are correct.

Thanks for your hard work."

114,Everything in the survey went fine with no issues. We seem to have a lot of conspiracy theory nuts in the world today and I think it's a sign of the larger mental health crisis that's currently going on.

140,Air AND water make up the bulk of trees mass and the water is drawn from the earth. Water has much more mass than air and I stand by my answer of Earth being that is where the water is drawn from. The question was very vague and as you see... open to interpretation

159,I think scientists are acting in the best interests of science rather than the community directly. An unethical scientist could advance scientific knowledge while hurting humanity.
161,Mo Thanks
164,"I appreciate science but understand that if scientists don't go along with what investors/govt want they won't receive grants for funding. I also very recently lived through several years of gaslighting about covid. While I realize I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, I'm not a total idiot. Things that were censored at the beginning of the pandemic are now allowed to be discussed freely. Science should be publicly debated otherwise it isn't science."
