8,I didn’t know the answers at all so they could have been either one.
12,questions were out of my realm and I had no interest in researching it
15,"I am not privy to information in he scientific field. I believe it to mostly be factual, but I'm unsure about discrepancies so I have to assume it may be true."
20,I agreed with certain things because it's just how I felt.
23,"I didn't verify anything, nor do I really trust scientists, I guess I just believe that it's generally possible and seems like a reasonable calculation."
25,Not sure
26,I wasn't sure either way.
35,"Neither, because I would have to do my own research beyond the untrustworthy sources you provided."
39,I mostly agree because I obtained information from opposing sources and formed an opinion.
46,I guessed
63,I haven't been able to independently verify it.  But I could if I wanted to and that information was something we could accurately figure out and prove it.
85,"I mostly agree with the consensus because they weren't politically-charged topics, and also, I've been able to independently verify the statements."
90,There is no way for normal people to verify claims made by scientists with access to vast resources
92,Seemed to be accurate
97,"I didn't really care what the answer was to those questions, so I just went with the flow."
99,I do not agree
104,It was just a guess.
109,i agreed with the consensus because i have not done my own research to refute it so what choice did i have. there’s not time enough on a survey for me to genuinely refute or agree so i mildly agree
110,I chose that I didn’t
113,I agree that things have been made and are scientifically real but not a billion or million years the bible does not confirm this and its smarter then science
130,I trust honest and ethical scientists.  The challenge is to find out who they are.  Science is an extraordinary discipline.  It should never be used to deceive and control us.
132,A combination of both as I didn't check all of them but the ones that I did in deed checked out.
143,I didn't have a reason to disagree with it.
152,"ALmost everything is subjective and ""science"" is wrong again and again although some things are objectively true with empirical evidence like math and 2 + 2 = 4"
157,I believe some of the questions are easier to verify than others.
158,I don't trust them that much because they are bought and paid for.
162,I agreed because of my trust in scientists.
168,"I would agree if the subject involved could be independently verified, independent as in a non-aligned individual with any interests involving it."
173,"A mix of both, it largely depends on the subject matter. I will say I do not have a whole lot of trust in scientists as they are by and large secular in their views which distorts them a tremendous amount."
175,The points I can agree with make sense and dont go against the Word of God.
187,I agreed because of my own research and knowledge coincides with the consensus.
189,Agreed because I didn’t want to verify the information.
