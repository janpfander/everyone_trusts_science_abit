Homo erectus, appearing around 1.9 million years ago, represents a major stride in human evolution with a more sophisticated tool kit, improved cognitive abilities, and the ability to migrate beyond Africa.<br><br>\nApproximately 300,000 years ago, Homo sapiens emerged in Africa, showcasing a further increase in brain size, complex language, and symbolic thinking. This species displayed remarkable adaptability, spreading across the globe and interacting with other hominin species, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The development of sophisticated tools, art, and cultural practices demonstrated the cognitive and creative capacities of Homo sapiens.<br>\n<br>\nOver time, Homo sapiens diversified into different populations, adapting to various environments and developing unique cultural traits. The advent of agriculture around 10,000 years ago marked a pivotal shift, leading to settled communities, increased social complexity, and the rise of civilizations.<br><br>\nThe evolution of the genus Homo is characterized by a continuous interplay between biological and cultural evolution.

For instance, in one species, sometimes the workers mostly let female reproductive offspring survive, and sometimes mostly the males. Using mathematical models of evolution, the researchers have been able to show that the worker ants from the same colony should mostly let female reproductive offsprings live when the queen has only mated with one male. They then observed that this is exactly what the ants were doing, and that the worker ants were able to figure out whether they all had the same father or not by smelling each other.","DataExportTag":"ants_imp_text","QuestionID":"QID120"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9t4DAXD30dt1NwG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID197","SecondaryAttribute":"Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.\u00a0","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.&nbsp;<\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q1","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.\u00a0","Choices":[],"ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":1,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID197"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9t4DAXD30dt1NwG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID198","SecondaryAttribute":"Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.\u00a0","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"<div>Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.&nbsp;<\/div>","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.\u00a0","Choices":[],"ChoiceOrder":[],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":1,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"<div>Now we are going to ask some questions about yourself.&nbsp;<\/div>","DataExportTag":"Q198","QuestionID":"QID198"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9t4DAXD30dt1NwG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID242","SecondaryAttribute":"Proof of alien contact is being concealed from the public.","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Proof of alien contact is being concealed from the public.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"BCTI_alien","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAHR","SubSelector":"TX","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","LabelPosition":"BELOW"},"QuestionDescription":"Proof of alien contact is being concealed from the public.","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Completely false&nbsp;<br\/>1"},"2":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>2"},"3":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>3"},"4":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>4"},"5":{"Display":"Unsure&nbsp;<br\/>5"},"6":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>6"},"7":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>7"},"8":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>8"},"9":{"Display":"Completely true&nbsp;<br\/>9"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"RecodeValues":{"1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9"},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":10,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID242"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9t4DAXD30dt1NwG","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID78","SecondaryAttribute":"Some might think about archeology as a somewhat dusty discipline, one that simply unearths broken...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"Some might think about archeology as a somewhat dusty discipline, one that simply unearths broken pots without making much progress.
