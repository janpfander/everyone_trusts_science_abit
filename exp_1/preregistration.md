# Introduction

Anti-vax people or climate skepticists are often conceived of as simply anti-science. But would these people deny that water is made of molecules containing one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, and that its chemical formula therefore is H2O? We suspect that everyone, including people who hold-anti science conspiracy beliefs, trusts basic science at least to some degree.

# Data collection

No data has been collected yet.

# Procedure

After providing their consent to participate in the study, participants will pass an attention check:

> *While watching the television, have you ever had a fatal heart attack?* [1-6; 1 = Never, 6 = Often]

Participants will then read the following instructions:

> *We will ask you 11 questions about science. After each question, we will provide you with the scientifically consensual answer and ask whether you accept it.*

Next, participants will answer a set of 11 basic science questions, all but two extracted from existing science knowledge questionnaires. After each question, participants will be presented with an answer reflecting the scientific consensus. Participants are asked to choose whether they accept the anwser or not, before proceeding to the next question. Figure \@ref(fig:stimulus-example) displays the survey for an example science question. Table \@ref(tab:knowledge) shows all included questions, their scientifically consensual answer, and their source.

## Conspiracy scales

We rely on three scales:

The conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) by @bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013 :

I think that . . .

-   ... many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about. - politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.
-   ... government agencies closely monitor all citizens.
-   ... events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.
-   ... there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions.

[0% - 100%; 0 = certainly not, 100 = certain]

The Single Item Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (SICBS) by @lantianMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2016 :

I think that the official version of the events given by the authorities very often hides the truth.

[1-9; 1 = Completely false, 5 = Unsure, 9 = Completely true]

A selection of science/health related conspiracy theories from the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by @pennycookOverconfidentlyConspiratorialConspiracy2022, displayed in table \@ref(tab:conspiracy).

## Trust in science

We rely on three items, the first two selected from the Wellcome Trust survey, the second one from the Pew research center and which has recently been used by a world-wide many labs study:

-   How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

-   In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

-   How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the public? [1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence]

# Research questions

RQ1: What is the average science knowledge score (1)

We will report the average percentage of questions answered correctly. We will look at the pooled average. We will also look at the distribution of participant averages.

RQ2: What is the average acceptance of the scientific consensus (2)

Similar to RQ1, we will report the average acceptance rate of the scientific consensus. We will look at the pooled average and at the distribution of participant averages.

RQ3: What is the relationship between trust in science and, respectively, (1) and (2)?

We will regress trust in science on the average knowledge and acceptance per participant.

Which trust question do we rely on?

A mix of the two wgm questions, if the correlate well. Otherwise the "how much do you trust science question".

We will run a robustness check on the pew question (acting in the best interest of the public is a sub-aspect of trust).

We will also check how well these scales correlate.

RQ4: What is the relationship between conspiracy thinking and, respectively, (1) and (2)?

We will proceed just as for RQ3, but with conspiracy thinking as outcome, instead of trust.

We will use the precise conspiracy items.

As robustness checks, we will run on the two other scales.

We will also check how well these scales correlate.

# Exclusions

We will exclude participants who do not answer “Never” in the attention check.
