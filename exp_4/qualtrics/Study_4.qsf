They are found in nearly every environment, from the depths of oceans to the highest mountains, showcasing their incredible adaptability and resilience.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>One of the defining features of insects is their segmented bodies, consisting of three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Most insects also possess six legs, although some species have lost or modified them for various purposes. These legs are typically adapted for walking, jumping, swimming, or grasping, depending on the insect's lifestyle.&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Another characteristic of insects is their exoskeleton, a hard outer covering made primarily of chitin. This exoskeleton provides support and protection for the insect's body and serves as an attachment point for muscles, allowing for efficient movement. However, it also limits their size, as insects must molt periodically to grow.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Insects exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including herbivory, carnivory, omnivory, and scavenging. Some insects, like butterflies and bees, are important pollinators, playing a crucial role in the reproduction of many plant species.

From the rudimentary tool use of Homo habilis to the complex societies of Homo sapiens, this journey illustrates the remarkable adaptability and innovation that define human evolution.<br>\n&nbsp;<\/p>","DataExportTag":"archeo_basic_text","QuestionID":"QID115"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9R01DMGVlnCrBCS","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID237","SecondaryAttribute":"The spread of certain viruses and\/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed efforts...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"The spread of certain viruses and\/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed efforts of vested interests.","DefaultChoices":false,"DataExportTag":"BCTI_viruses","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAHR","SubSelector":"TX","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText","LabelPosition":"BELOW"},"QuestionDescription":"The spread of certain viruses and\/or diseases is the result of the deliberate, concealed efforts...","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Completely false&nbsp;<br\/>1"},"2":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>2"},"3":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>3"},"4":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>4"},"5":{"Display":"Unsure&nbsp;<br\/>5"},"6":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>6"},"7":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>7"},"8":{"Display":"&nbsp;<br\/>8"},"9":{"Display":"Completely true&nbsp;<br\/>9"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"ON","ForceResponseType":"ON","Type":"None"}},"RecodeValues":{"1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9"},"GradingData":[],"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":10,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionID":"QID237"}},{"SurveyID":"SV_9R01DMGVlnCrBCS","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID235","SecondaryAttribute":"There has been much debate about various historical events, suggesting that the \u2018official version.","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"There has been much debate about various historical events, suggesting that the \n\u2018official version\u2019 of the truth of those events is something of a cover-up.
