Do antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria?,Antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria,"Yes, both; No, only viruses; No, only bacteria","There is a consensus among scientists that antibiotics kill bacteria, but not viruses. ","(Sturgis & Allum, 2004), (Miller, 2004), (Miller, 1998) (Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989), (Gauchat, 2011), (Pardo & Calvo, 2004), (Hayes & Tariq, 2000), (Committee et al., 2016)
","Antibiotics specifically target and kill bacteria, not viruses. Scientists know this thanks to extensive laboratory experiments and clinical trials where antibiotics have been observed to be effective against bacterial infections but not viral ones. Scientists have also studied how antibiotics work, which typically involve disrupting bacterial cell processes like cell wall synthesis or protein production, which are absent in viruses.

"Are electrons smaller, larger, or the same size as atoms ?",Electrons are smaller than atoms,Smaller; Same size; Larger,There is a consensus among scientists that electrons are smaller than atoms.,"(Sturgis & Allum, 2004), (Miller, 2004), (Miller, 1998), (Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989), (Gauchat 2011), (Pardo & Calvo, 2004), Committee et al., 2016","Electrons are much smaller than atoms. Scientists know this thanks to experiments in particle physics, such as electron scattering experiments. They are also able to measure the electron charge and mass. Additionally, atomic theory and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical framework explaining the structure of atoms, where electrons orbit the nucleus in distinct energy levels.

Have the continents on Earth been moving for millions of years or have they always been where they are now?,The continents on which we live have been moving their location for millions of years and will continue to move in the future,They have been moving; They have always been where they are now,There is a consensus among scientists that the continents on Earth have been moving for millions of years due to plate tectonics.,"(Miller, 2004) and (Miller, 1998), (Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989)
(Gauchat, 2011), (Pardo & Calvo, 2004)","The continents on Earth have been moving for millions of years due to plate tectonics. Scientists have gathered evidence from various sources, including fossil records, geological formations, and the magnetic properties of rocks. The theory of plate tectonics explains how the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large, rigid plates that move over the semi-fluid asthenosphere, leading to phenomena like continental drift, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.

"What decides whether a baby is a boy or a girl ? Is it the father’s genes, the mother’s genes, or both?",It is the father’s genes that decide whether the baby is a boy or a girl,The mother's genes; the father's genes; both ,There is a consensus among scientists that it is the genes in the father's sperm which are decisive on whether a baby is a boy or a girl.,"(Sturgis & Allum, 2004), (Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989), (Gauchat, 2011), (Pardo & Calvo, 2004), (Committee et al., 2016)","Chromosomes are structures found in the nucleus of cells that carry long pieces of DNA. Two of the chromosomes (the X and the Y chromosome) are called sex chromosomes. In most cases, females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. At conception, the mother transmits an X chromosome, and the father may contribute an X or a Y. The chromosome from the father therefore determines if the baby is female (if the father transmits an X) or male (if the father transmits a Y). In most cases, children are born a male or female according to their chromosomes. However, some children may be born with genitalia that do not match their chromosomes.

Do lasers work by focusing sound waves?,Lasers work by focusing sound waves,Yes; No,There is a consensus among scientists that lasers do not work by focusing sound waves. ,"(Sturgis & Allum, 2004), (Miller, 2004) and (Miller, 1998), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989), (Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Gauchat , 2011), (Pardo & Calvo, 2004), (Committee et al., 2016)","Lasers work by focusing light, not sound waves. They produce a narrow beam of light in which all particles of light have very similar wavelengths. It works through optical amplification, while sound waves are generated by vibrations. This is why laser beams are very narrow, very bright, and can be focused into a very tiny spot. Because laser light stays focused and does not spread much (like a flashlight would), laser beams can travel very long distances. The behaviour of lasers (interference, diffraction patterns, polarization) exhibit the properties of light as predicted by classical and quantum physics.

"How long does it take for Earth to go around the sun: one day, one month, or one year ?",It takes one month for Earth to go around the sun,One day; One month; One year,There is a consensus among scientists that it takes one year for Earth to go around the sun. ,"(Tourangeau et al., 2016), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989), (Gauchat, 2011)","Earth takes approximately one year to orbit the sun. This knowledge is based on astronomical observations and measurements of celestial motion.

Are diamonds made of carbon ?,Diamonds are made of carbon,Yes; No,There is a consensus among scientists that diamonds are made of carbon. ,"(Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989)","Diamonds are made of only one element, carbon. Carbon is the same element that makes coal or graphite used for pencils. Why are diamonds transparent and hard while coal and graphite are opaque and soft? It all comes down to the placement of their atoms. In diamonds, each carbon atom is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms, while in graphite, each atom is only bonded to 3 other carbon atoms. The bonds in diamonds are held in such a tight structure that all light passes around them, which is why diamonds look transparent. In coal and graphite, light gets trapped between the atoms, which is why they look dark and opaque. Why do carbon atoms bond differently in diamonds? At very high pressures and temperatures, the carbon atoms are squeezed so much that they start touching more atoms. When the pressure is about 50,000 times the pressure at the surface of the Earth and the temperature is about 1600°C, the carbon atoms bond with 4 other atoms and result in diamonds.

Which travels faster : light or sound?,Light travels faster than sound,Light; Sound,There is a consensus among scientists that light travels faster than sound. ,"(Miller, 2004) and (Miller, 1998), (Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989)
","Light travels faster than sound. This conclusion arises from numerous experiments and observations in physics. You can also experience this for yourself during a thunderstorm. Unless the lighting is right above you, you will first see the lighting, then hear the thunder some time after (you can even tell how far the lighting struck by counting how many seconds it takes for the thunder to reach you). More precisely, the speed of light has been measured accurately using techniques such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Similarly, the speed of sound has been measured through experiments involving the propagation of sound waves through various materials.

Is common table salt made of calcium carbonate? ,Common table salt is made of calcium carbonate,Yes; No,There is a consensus among scientists that common table salt is not made of calcium carbonate; it is made of sodium chloride.,"(Evans & Durant, 1995) and (Durant et al., 1989)","Common table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is not made of calcium carbonate. Scientists can use a variety of tests to understand what matter is made of. The most used test for sodium chloride is the chemical reaction with silver nitrate. The presence of sodium chloride yields a white precipitate upon drops of a silver nitrate solution. Calcium carbonate, by contrast, is the substance that makes up, for instance, chalk.
