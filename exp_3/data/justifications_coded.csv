5,lasers,It is what I believed I was taught,4,4,4
12,antibiotics,I do not know,1,1,1
20,water,I think I got it confused in my head. I was thinking 2 oxygen and 1 hydrogen.,2,2,2
25,electrons,I made a mistake.,2,2,2
26,antibiotics,I have always experienced receiving antibiotic for viral infections. So i do not agree that antibiotic does not kill viruses.,4,4,4
32,antibiotics,Because I realized that my thinking was not correct.,2,2,2
32,orbit,After thinking about it I realized  that it does take a year for the sun to go around the earth.,2,2,2
38,continents,The earth is not millions of years old.,5,4,4
38,orbit,The earth is flat and stationary.,4,4,4
43,water,I got it confused. Its true. One oxygen and  2 hydrogen is what i learned in school.,2,2,2
46,sex,Yes.  Its normal to think that however not always.,1,1,1
53,continents,The Earth was created aged by God and has not been around for millions of years. I do not believe in evolution but rather creation based on the Word of God.,5,5,5
61,continents,I do not believe that the universe is millions of years old,5,4,4
62,continents,I do not believe the theory that the earth is that old.,5,4,4
65,electrons,Because I would like to see more research on this matter.,3,3,3
65,antibiotics,Because I would like to see more research on this matter.,3,3,3
65,continents,Because I would like to see more research on this matter.,3,3,3
65,diamonds,Because I would like to see more research on this matter.,3,3,3
65,water,Because I would like to see more research on this matter.,3,3,3
72,lasers,That’s the truth,2,4,2
72,salt,I wasn’t sure,1,1,1
83,continents,The Earth has only been around for 6-7 thousand years. As far as I know however the Continents have been moving.,5,4,4
83,water,"I thought it was """"2 parts oxide, one hydrogen."""" I was of course wrong. I also miss clicked the wrong answer for how long it takes the Earth the revolve around the sun... I think.",2,2,2
87,electrons,I believe atoms are the smallest particles.,1,4,4
87,continents,On second thought I agree.,2,2,2
87,diamonds,On second thought I believe I agree.,2,2,2
87,water,This does not fit according to my recollection.,1,4,4
92,salt,I meant to agree I did not know the answer.,2,2,2
96,electrons,I don't think electrons are smaller just because that is what we were taught in science,4,3,4
96,continents,This is something we are taught academically in science it may not be true,4,3,4
98,antibiotics,I think there are two different kinds of antibiotics. One type kills bacteria infections and the other type kills viral infections,4,4,4
99,continents,I don't have a reason to believe Earth has been here for millions of years so I don't agree with the consensus. Of course I know I could be wrong.,5,3,4
102,continents,This information is based in evolution which is a theory.,5,3,4
109,continents,I partially agree that continents have moved due to plate tectonics. But I don't believe the Earth is as old as it mentions in the explanation and is much younger. I also disagree with scientific consensus and there is really no such thing. Because with science when you base things on evidence and then find new evidence you have to change your theory. So there is really no such thing as consensus there is data facts and theories.,5,4,4
112,antibiotics,No,1,1,1
112,speed,No,1,1,1
112,salt,No,1,1,1
117,antibiotics,Not really. I thought they killed virus' but maybe I am wrong. heh.,1,4,1
117,sex,I thought both male and female decided the fate of the babies gender.,1,4,1
122,antibiotics,antibotics only kill bacteria,2,2,2
122,lasers,I thought they light was a lot faster than sound waves,1,4,1
122,salt,not sure,1,1,1
129,continents,YES I believe in a young earth.  I do not accept the tax supported theory of evolution.,5,4,4
130,antibiotics,I was confused.,2,2,2
132,continents,Continental drift is an unproven theory. I have seen no actual evidence for it. Flooding and receding of waters are more likely the cause of coastline changes throughout history.,4,4,4
132,orbit,There is no scientific evidence that the earth moves at all except for earthquakes. The sun is clearly moving around the earth in a daily circular pattern. The sun is much smaller and closer than we have been taught.,4,4,4
142,salt,I thought it was made up of that.,1,4,1
143,lasers,Lasers operate based on the principles of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation typically light.,2,1,2
146,antibiotics,Different knowledge and experience.,4,1,4
146,sex,A mothers choice not the fathers choice because of religious beliefs.,5,5,5
146,diamonds,Gained through knowledge and skills.,4,4,4
150,speed,To be honest I did actually hear the concept that like travels fashion and sound so I’m not sure why I picked that answer.,2,1,1
151,lasers,"I accidentally clicked the other answer I'm not going to lie. As soon as I clicked it on accident I was like """"Sh*t"""". I meant to choose the other answer on this one, I'm sorry.",2,2,2
151,salt,I misunderstood this question. This one confused me the most even though it's right in front of me. Sorry.,2,2,2
155,salt,error,2,2,2
158,lasers,No I did not know this question.,1,1,1
158,salt,I knew this one and just blanked on the answer.,2,2,2
159,sex,I thought I read it said in most cases women transmit an X chromosome but now I'm not sure.,1,4,1
161,antibiotics,I thought antibiotics kills every bit of poison.,1,4,1
166,electrons,I'm not sure I dont' understand it,1,1,1
166,water,I'm not sure I dont' understand it,1,1,1
171,diamonds,It just doesn't sit well with me.,4,4,4
172,sex,I was wrong. I agree with scientific consensus.,2,2,2
173,orbit,Yes the scientist now more than I do,1,2,2
178,electrons,I was incorrect on this.,2,2,2
191,antibiotics,I could be wrong but I thought they killed viruses as well.,1,4,1
191,continents,I do not believe without a doubt the earth has been around for millions of years.,5,4,4
196,sex,Answered incorrectly in error.  I agree with the scientific consensus.,2,2,2
197,antibiotics,I’ve taken antibiotics numerous of times and although my sickness is usually cured I always get a yeast infection as result. This always happens since the antibiotics kill the good and bad bacteria in the body.,4,4,4
197,sex,I believe that God decides whether parents will be blessed with a boy or girl. It had nothing to do with genetics.,5,5,5
197,diamonds,This just doesn’t seem correct even after viewing the article from the university. I can’t explain why but I can’t justify it.,1,3,3
198,diamonds,I just never heard of diamonds being made of carbon and it makes zero sense to me while thinking about it.,3,4,3
200,continents,The earth is not old but young. Not billions or millions but thanks of years.,5,4,4
200,orbit,One day because the sun is not taking a year to light up other parts of the earth.,4,4,4
