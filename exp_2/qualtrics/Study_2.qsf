Carbon is the same element that makes coal or graphite used for pencils. Why are diamonds transparent and hard while coal and graphite are opaque and soft? It all comes down to the placement of their atoms. In diamonds, each carbon atom is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms, while in graphite, each atom is only bonded to 3 other carbon atoms. The bonds in diamonds are held in such a tight structure that all light passes around them, which is why diamonds look transparent. In coal and graphite, light gets trapped between the atoms, which is why they look dark and opaque. Why do carbon atoms bond differently in diamonds? At very high pressures and temperatures, the carbon atoms are squeezed so much that they start touching more atoms.

This exoskeleton provides support and protection for the insect's body and serves as an attachment point for muscles, allowing for efficient movement. However, it also limits their size, as insects must molt periodically to grow.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Insects exhibit a wide range of feeding habits, including herbivory, carnivory, omnivory, and scavenging.
