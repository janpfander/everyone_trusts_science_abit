# Introduction

In a first study (https://osf.io/8utsj/) we tested whether participants would accept the scientific consensus on basic science facts. Most participants did, but not for all the questions. In this survey, we make two main adjustments to further investigate rejection of consensus: (i) we add a longer explanation and sources, instead of only stating the consensus. If it was the case that participants did not mistrust the science, but us the experimenters, this should increase acceptance; (ii) every time a participant rejects the scientific consensus, we ask them an open-ended question to explain why they did so. We also remove one science question that we had added ourselves (on where trees mainly draw there materials from to grow; answer: air), because the results were very different compared to other questions, suggesting the question might have been confusing.

# Data collection

No data has been collected yet.

# Procedure

After providing their consent to participate in the study, participants are given an attention check:

> *While watching the television, have you ever had a fatal heart attack?* [1-6; 1 = Never, 6 = Often]

Participants then read the following instructions:

> *We will ask you 10 questions about science. After each question, we will provide you with the scientifically consensual answer and ask whether you accept it.*

Next, participants answer a set of 10 basic science questions, all but one extracted from existing science knowledge questionnaires. After each question, participants will be presented with an answer reflecting the scientific consensus, along with an explanation which we wrote, partly based on explanations generated by ChatGPT, and three links to authoritative sources supporting the answer. Participants are asked to choose whether they accept the answer or not, before proceeding to the next question. Figure 1 displays the survey for an example science question. Table 1 shows all included questions, their scientifically consensual answer, the explanations, and their source.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Antibiotics specifically target and kill bacteria, not viruses. Scientists know this thanks to extensive laboratory experiments and clinical trials where antibiotics have been observed to be effective against bacterial infections but not viral ones. Scientists have also studied how antibiotics work, which typically involve disrupting bacterial cell processes like cell wall synthesis or protein production, which are absent in viruses.

They are also able to measure the electron charge and mass. Additionally, atomic theory and quantum mechanics provide a theoretical framework explaining the structure of atoms, where electrons orbit the nucleus in distinct energy levels.

Scientists have gathered evidence from various sources, including fossil records, geological formations, and the magnetic properties of rocks. The theory of plate tectonics explains how the Earth's lithosphere is divided into large, rigid plates that move over the semi-fluid asthenosphere, leading to phenomena like continental drift, earthquakes, and volcanic activity.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Chromosomes are structures found in the nucleus of cells that carry long pieces of DNA. Two of the chromosomes (the X and the Y chromosome) are called sex chromosomes. In most cases, females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. At conception, the mother transmits an X chromosome, and the father may contribute an X or a Y. The chromosome from the father therefore determines if the baby is female (if the father transmits an X) or male (if the father transmits a Y). In most cases, children are born a male or female according to their chromosomes. However, some children may be born with genitalia that do not match their chromosomes.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Lasers produce a narrow beam of light in which all of the particles of light have very similar wavelengths. The laser’s lightwaves travel together with their peaks all lined up, in phase. This is why laser beams are very narrow, very bright, and can be focused into a very tiny spot. Because laser light stays focused and does not spread out much (like a flashlight would), laser beams can travel very long distances.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Diamonds are made of only one element, carbon. Carbon is the same element that makes coal or graphite used for pencils. Why are diamonds transparent and hard while coal and graphite are opaque and soft? It all comes down to the placement of their atoms. In diamonds, each carbon atom is bonded to 4 other carbon atoms, while in graphite, each atom is only bonded to 3 other carbon atoms. The bonds in diamonds are held in such a tight structure that all light passes around them, which is why diamonds look transparent. In coal and graphite, light gets trapped between the atoms, which is why they look dark and opaque. Why do carbon atoms bond differently in diamonds? At very high pressures and temperatures, the carbon atoms are squeezed so much that they start touching more atoms. When the pressure is about 50,000 times the pressure at the surface of the Earth and the temperature is about 1600°C, the carbon atoms bond with 4 other atoms and result in diamonds.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Light travels faster than sound. This conclusion arises from numerous experiments and observations in physics. You can also experience this for yourself during a thunderstorm. Unless the lighting is right above you, you will first see the lighting, then hear the thunder some time after (you can even tell how far the lighting struck by counting how many seconds it takes for the thunder to reach you). More precisely, the speed of light has been measured accurately using techniques such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Similarly, the speed of sound has been measured through experiments involving the propagation of sound waves through various materials.

   <td style="text-align:left;width: 20em; "> Common table salt, or sodium chloride (NaCl), is not made of calcium carbonate. Scientists can use a variety of tests to understand what matter is made of. The most used test for sodium chloride is the chemical reaction with silver nitrate. The presence of sodium chloride yields a white precipitate upon drops of a silver nitrate solution. Calcium carbonate, by contrast, is the substance that makes up, for instance, chalk.

We know this for instance because if you set hydrogen on fire in a container with oxygen, water will form on the sides of the container. More recent techniques such as spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography have allowed scientists to more directly see the composition and structure of water molecules, confirming the presence of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.

## Conspiracy scales

We rely on three scales:

1.  The conspiracy mentality questionnaire (CMQ) by @bruderMeasuringIndividualDifferences2013 :

I think that . . .

-   ... many very important things happen in the world, which the public is never informed about. - politicians usually do not tell us the true motives for their decisions.
-   ... government agencies closely monitor all citizens.
-   ... events which superficially seem to lack a connection are often the result of secret activities.
-   ... there are secret organizations that greatly influence political decisions.

[0% - 100%; 0 = certainly not, 100 = certain]

2.  The Single Item Conspiracy Beliefs Scale (SICBS) by @lantianMeasuringBeliefConspiracy2016 :

-   I think that the official version of the events given by the authorities very often hides the truth. [1-9; 1 = Completely false, 5 = Unsure, 9 = Completely true]

3.  A selection of science/health related conspiracy theories from the Belief in Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by @pennycookOverconfidentlyConspiratorialConspiracy2022, displayed in table \@ref(tab:conspiracy).

## Trust in science

We rely on three items. The first two were selected from the Wellcome Global Monitor survey. The third one is from the Pew research center and has recently been used by a world-wide many labs study [@colognaTrustScientistsTheir2024]. We consider "acting in the best interest of the public" as a sub-aspect of trust, and include this question mainly to be able to compare our sample to a wide ranging global sample.

-   How much do you trust scientists in this country? Do you trust them a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

-   In general, would you say that you trust science a lot, some, not much, or not at all? [1 = Not at all, 2 = Not much, 3 = Some, 4 = A lot]

-   How much confidence do you have in scientists to act in the best interests of the public? [1-5; 1 = No confidence at all, 5 = A great deal of confidence]

# Research questions

-   **RQ1: What is the average science knowledge score (1)?**

We will report the average percentage of questions answered correctly. We will look at the pooled average and the distribution of participant averages.

In light of the previous study, we change RQ2 to:

-  **RQ2: When a participant’s answer does not match the consensus, how often do they change their mind and accept the consensus (2)?**

Similar to RQ1, we will report the average acceptance rate of the scientific consensus, when it was not already known. We will look at the pooled average and the distribution of participant averages.

-  **RQ3: What reasons do participants provide to justify their rejection of the scientific consensus?**

We will conduct a qualitative analysis and, if there are enough answers, attempt to categorize them.

In light of the results to the first study, we formulate the following hypotheses:

-  **H1a: Higher trust in science is associated with more science knowledge.**
-  **H1b: Higher trust in science is associated with more acceptance of the scientific consensus, given the consensus is not already known.**

We will regress trust in science on the average knowledge and acceptance (for those who initially disagreed) per participant. We will standardize all measures such that the regression coefficient yields a the correlation.

We will focus on the “How much do you trust science?” question, but conduct robustness checks on the two other trust questions.

We will also check how well the three trust items correlate.

-  **H2a: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with more science knowledge.**
-  **H2b: Higher conspiracy thinking is associated with more acceptance of the scientific consensus, given the consensus is not already known.**

We will proceed just as for H1, but with conspiracy thinking as predictor, instead of trust.

To measure conspiracy thinking, we will use the average score of the Conspiracy Theory Inventory (BCTI) by Pennycook, Binnendyk, and Rand (2022). As robustness checks, we will run the same analysis separately for the two other conspiracy scales.

We will also check how well the three conspiracy scales correlate.

# Participants

We will recruit 200 participants from the US. 

# Exclusions

We will exclude participants who do not answer “Never” in the attention check.
